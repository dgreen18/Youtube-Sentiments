"20","like you were saying your pop feminism video, feminism has taken over mainstream society and i don't know what it all means anymore.  

i was what i would call an armchair feminist in college, like most other ciswomen who generally cared about women's rights but hadn't read much feminist theory literature.  then under the influence of a fairly misogynistic ex boyfriend, i was introduced to karen straughan videos (she's an anti-feminist who's somewhat infamous on the internet for ""dismantling"" and speaking out against feminism even though she's a woman).  then i was jordan pertersonified, and took the red pill (watched the documentary).  

i disagree with what seem to be  the fundamental tennants of feminism, and therefore, don't think i can call myself a feminist.  i would never deny that sexism and gender bias against women has always existed and still does, and that this has affected society in ways that has given men more of the power overall (which is why i suppose we continue to talk about the ""patriarchy"").  but i don't think feminists' analysis of social issues is remotely nuanced enough, and find that a lot of modern feminism is toxic and misandric.  i also think much of history has been reframed and is now viewed through a biased, radical feminist perspective.  i guess my main problem is that i haven't been exposed to enough moderate feminists, and certainly none that can debate rationally.  so, i don't know exactly what modern feminism even is, at its core.  

the defining outcome of first wave feminism was the vote.  for second wave feminism, it was giving women more reproductive rights through the pill and roe vs wade, as well as career options and respect.  what is the focus of third wave feminism?  

i know this is a tall order, but i would love to see you make a comprehensive video on feminist theory and the history of gender politics and the women's rights movement."

"35","i would definitely consider myself a feminist, but i was a sjw for 3 months and the people i met were the worst, most self-centered, and the most mindless people i have met. i still like the ideals sjw stand for and support the ideas, but i just can never get behind being a sjw again or approving of the whole sjw movement."
"36","are men just more visual creatures than women? i get why catcalling is wrong, but it's difficult for me to understand why it's wrong that you looked at the woman's nice legs on the subway. i ""check out"" men all the time (i am a gay man), and i presume that everybody ""checks out"" strangers they find attractive. the key is to be subtle and try not to make anyone uncomfortable. but how is this act of seeing in itself sexist? do women never do it?"

"43","i'm a black female conservative leaning weeb and i have to say that i fucking



love your vids. you, unlike most """"""sjws"""""" don't use buzzfeed buzz words and passive-aggressive insults to get your points across. did i mention that i liked you?"
"44","you're so lovely <3"
"45","i love them so much tbh"
"46","why can't i look at beautiful women, when women often look at beautiful males.... i mean, it's not on purpose.
it's not like a give a creepy stare or something.... i just tend to notice how good she looks.... so,
what's wrong with that?"
"47","omg. when did this become age restricted? :/"
"48","hahahahaha 😂 loved the 50 shades of grey displayed carelessly in the back 😂"
"49","and the i ended up like this. the end. lol"
"50","i had a ""feminist"" guy friend mock the idea of romance novels and my wanting to read them. what women like is generally considered childish or stupid while what men like is sophisticated and high art."
"51","it's not sexist to look at people tho... if someone goes out in public, they're agreeing to let people look at them. they choose what they get to show to the world. none of it is yours to touch or talk about, and it certainly doesn't give anyone the excuse to sexually harass or assault someone no matter what they're wearing, but by going out in a short skirt or whatever you're giving everyone around you the right to look at your legs. same goes for everybody, no matter what gender or other criteria."
"52","that intro...contrapoints is howtobasics?"
"53","this is cancer"
"54","i am enjoying these videos - there are topics out there i want to know a bit more about, but they are disturbing and i am basically a fragile little bean who gets scared by the people and upset by the scope of it all. you are super funny and i don't hate myself when i watch your videos, which is a good sign."
"55","you're a tranny lunatic, becoming a feminist sjw is no surprise to anyone lol."
"56","the horrid crime of finding someone attractive ...*flogs self*"
"57","pride and prejudice is, i just saw the movie, is actually feminist because the point of view from a rather indepenent women for its time, but has her question her point of view as well, that you cant believe first assumptions, that the guy is guilty of that, as is she because the guy had actually good and even noble intentions she didnt knew. and that both are terrible at comunicating that.and its not a the woman is automaticly right and surpressed point of view, and same for her love interest guy.. that the system itself is lawed but men are not the enemy. the women counting the men on their wealth is a nice touch too. but again just saw the movie.

that is what feminism shouild be, about equal treatment."
"58","your description of trying to figure out what to look at is something i deal with every day, thanks to autism."
"59","i thought the 'glancing' type strategy is what most people force themselves into who do not blatantly and antisocially stare or are utterly disinterested. similar to this ""oh no it must look like i'm staring, lets just focus on this interesting tree 20 cm to the left, i'm innocent""-kind of behaviour. i'm not sure if that's problematic, but my reaction to blatant staring has just always been to stare back until the person gets visibly uncomfortable and finally stops staring. i don't feel like it's a problem when people briefly look at my boobs once or twice. but i also think people usually don't have much self awareness if it isn't taught. so i guess it's not too bad if women show reactions to what i really like to call antisocial staring, as long as they are in an environment that is considered safe... so what i'm saying is, we kind of have to all work together to eventually all have our fair share of anxiety, glancing and personal awareness."
"60","what's wrong with looking at women's legs which are dressed in a way to attract looks, and give sexual arousal. i love when the women look at my hands or my strong hands lol and imagine shit. that's the only reason why i go to the gym. and still am pissed how that kind of a moments doesn't happen more often. it is natural to try to attract. and yes there is something about women being objectified, but thats what most of the women wants and enyoj, and expect from men. almost every women i have been with loved that, some hated that i was not doing it more, more mucalin, while i was just afraid to be an asshole coz i general i am a kind person."
"61","i want to point out that the subway rider with the hot legs wasn't merely looking back at you (unless you were already crossdressing then and a potential rival). she was looking back at the person who was looking at her body. that's what she was scanning for. she was seeing herself being seen. didn't you read berger's book?"
"62","god, i love this"
"63","i've looked at so many tiles. i fucking love tiles."
"64","i was a straight cis fem misogynist teen too. dismissing women and anything feminine is exceptionally pervasive and so becomes deeply ingrained without kids realizing or being able to process it. some people are just able to go their whole lives without the awareness, strength, independence of thought or empathy to ever consider that their programming isn't the same thing as truth."
"65","it's profound to hear someone talk about how they became more aware of others and being open to change. this topic isn't talked about enough. thank you."
"66","claiming equality is the goal while oppressing non-humans. wtaf

"67","hi! do you have a goodreads account? i think i'd be an interesting idea from which we could all get interesting reads. it's actually a really nice social network, from my perspective."
"68","0:55 and anyone to the right of trotsky is a fascist"
"69","that fifty shades of grey was really distracting.
which probably says more about me than anyone who owns the book.
oof..."
"70","ok so you can't look at people nowadays?"
"71","i know this is old and it's off topic, but i hope her makeup skills improved , especially that contour!!!"
"72","as a (cis)woman and a feminist, i have to say, i think catcalling is gross, i think staring is gross, but people look at people. all the time. every day. we tend to look longer at the things we find attractive.   you like women's legs, i like men's arms, and women's butts, especially when they're the shapes we like. we look. if we have some social skills we don't stare. we never catcall, because ew. we can be feminists and human at the same time, i think. i hope."
"73","i'll apologise if they notice 'cause it is somewhat creepy, but i shamelessly, and blatantly, look at butts....i like women; and lookin' don't hurt... women do this to other women or attractive men...so sorry, not sorry. can't help what i like."
"74","god your makeup really is bad in this video"
"75","yeah it kind of grates on me when far leftists dismiss something as ""borgeois spectacle"". i just roll my eyes."
"76","you say the white male perspective isn't bad, but then what is it? why is it so prevalent and other perspectives aren't? isn't the logical next step that the white male perspective is oppressive and corrupt and promoting it's own superiority? that's the slope that worries me about that line of thinking. it has to come with a low res narrative about history and the world we live in today that seems self destructive.

it's like, i either have to say shakespeare had nothing particularly special or universal or amazing to say in his plays because being white and male isn't particularly special or universal or amazing, or that white male literature is some of the best literature on the planet, feeding a white supremacist narrative. and if the case is that shakespeare did have truly universally human things to say and he was able to do it because hes white and male, then why would i even care to read it as ""white male"" literature? why not just extract the universal themes and treat the white maleness as it should be treated everyday: irrelevant to a person's ideas."
"77","midnight, the stars, and that outro. bravo"
"78","i think you changed your mind again on this book berger thing, please update the description a second time"
"79","i wouldn't consider this a story about becoming an sjw. just a story about becoming a decent human being. and a story about looking at the tile.

good to see you came around. i hope you inspire a lot of people to realize the same.

man my childhood seems so counter intuitive to me. i didn't read a fiction book till i was in my mid teens. i wasn't raised overtly male/masculine. what was stressed was independence.

trying to letting people in. socialize, and not come off really weird was a large portion of my college experience.  though a part of me will always be the sperg that wants to talk about insects, or physics; over interpersonal relationships."
"80","but word"
"81","why do i love that you said ""oopsie doodle"" lmaoooo"
"82","i know this is an old video but i will comment anyway since i have only recently discovered your channel. i majored in history for my undergrad. i have always found the disconnect between sexual expression and society fascinating. i studied pornography and discovered things like harris' list and films like bedtime for the bride that debuted literally months after the first public showing of films. i took a class that was titled sexual history in the united states. 

coincidentally this is about when the shit storm was being thrown at anita sarkeesian. for my last research paper for the class my professor wanted something relatively modern. i just so happened to know of a game called custer's revenge that created quite a stir. i only knew it existed and that people were pissed. after showing my professor the clip i got the go ahead to write it. 

i was definitely on the negative side of the conversation of everything i loved was sexist and awful. i dismissed the criticism entirely and was openly hostile toward it. what did i learn writing that paper about custer's revenge? that women had been saying things like this for decades but only now were being listened to. that was eye opening for me. it made me change my entire perspective on the whole debate and it made me shut my mouth and listen when these people were talking and telling their stories. it had me reflecting on the class as a whole and people saying the same thing about movies, photography, personal letters, politics there was just sexism bloody everywhere now. arguments being made now had been made so many decades ago and no one cared. it blew my mind a bit honestly. i feel i came out of that class a better person and i will be forever grateful to that professor."
"83","you know i actually like your videos a lot more post transition. you seem a lot more chill. the first video i saw was the one about incels abd was pretty stunned when you mentioned you were trans"
"84","""i can't sleep for more than two hours at a time, and i do not get erections anymore, but apart from that it's fine."" ahh yes. ssris. my nemesis."
"85","i'm so glad i'm not the only one who figured out that women hate being looked at by other people.
i can totally sympathise with that, if it was possible i'd be invisible."
"86","it's interesting to see that most of these videos counteracting the shitlords  are made by people who once believed those things and have sometimes done some pretty bad things themselves. i felt a bit helpless in the face of all the videos i was getting in my suggestions after subscribing to feminist frequency. i didn't even watch them because i knew it would be so much bullshit and i would feel i had to do something but i had other things to deal with and felt i was just asking for a whole load more trolling. i guess the pushback against them had to come from people who knew the way these people thought, and who know about making youtube videos. i've been making videos for years and still haven't bothered to get round to learning to edit beyond a bit off the front and a bit off the back. mind you i'm mainly just into martial arts, i just do the video thing as an extension of that and tend to think it's much better to spend my time training than editing. i think people of my age tend to think it's up journalists in respectable publications to take on this kind of shit, except they don't make youtube videos on the whole, plus tbh they are often a bit pro establishment and i don't feel they really are that thoughtful or understanding of what's going on with problems like this. they're mostly too busy pretending to be thoughtful about why trans people are just confused and really shouldn't be allowed in women's spaces or telling young people they shouldn't eat avocado toast and jeremy corbyn is definitely anti semitic, this comment on this picture they dragged up from some random post on facebook from years ago totally proves it. they certainly aren't prepared to try to get to grips with stuff like this."
"87","""tell me i'm a feminist! tell me i'm a nice guy you god damn bitch!"""
"88","❤️❤️"
"89","i don't quite understand this confronting people about looking at you. i try not to stare or be too obvious about it, but if there is something to see, i'll look. in case of this woman the proper answer would be probably: it was not me who dressed you that way, it was you who picked the clothes that reveal your legs because you know they look very nice and you want to show them off - but somehow i'm at fault for looking at them? screw that. what's on display, i'll look at. if you don't want people looking at any part of your body, cover it up."
"90","""eyes front and center  private, or i'll unscrew your head and shit down your neck!"" holy fuck that had me screeching"
"91","so good. tile watcher. <3"
"92","yep, i was a hard right anti-feminist evangelical shitlord until i decided to infiltrate the left to bolster my convictions. turns out i was the really entitled, uneducated,  hypocrite standing in a house with a straw foundation. 
welcome to dark side, feel free to take my hand, we can walk the road to hell together, friend."
"93","wait, was natalie a ""rational youtuber"" in the years past?"
"94","god, i hope watching old videos of yourself doesn't trigger you, now that you've started transition a few months ago. dysphoria seems to be really bad, i hope you're doing well!"
"95","dont try to be how to basic."
"96","girl what was going on with the liner"
"97","how is fight club promoting white male dominance? every elitist and masculine driven decision in the film leads to chaos. the twist of the film is that all the ""wise"" and ""enlightening"" ideas of tyler turned out to just be the toxic side of the characters brain"
"98","this is great. i wish other youtubers were as humble and self aware"
"99","it seems i love your mind now but would've had several disagreements in the past. good for you, but stop calling yourself an sjw, you aren't one. you're and advocate for what's right, as youve demonstrated in several of your videos. recognize that being american is about standing for what's right, not for what you feel is right. this is exceedingly difficult to differentiate, but still possible by saying simple words: ""i don't know"" and ""i was wrong about _____."" having reasons removed from logical fallacies is important to the health of ones ethics....""without rules, we'd be up in trees flinging crap at each other"" - red"
"100","just when i thought i couldn't love you more than i already do, you go and do something like this...and totally redeem yourself."
"101","i agree that objectification is wrong, but why are we to shame our sexuality to fix it?"

it's like, i either have to say shakespeare had nothing particularly special or universal or amazing to say in his plays because being white and male isn't particularly special or universal or amazing, or that white male literature is some of the best literature on the planet, feeding a white supremacist narrative. and if the case is that shakespeare did have truly universally human things to say and he was able to do it because hes white and male, then why would i even care to read it as ""white male"" literature? why not just extract the universal themes and treat the white maleness as it should be treated everyday: irrelevant to a person's ideas."

good to see you came around. i hope you inspire a lot of people to realize the same.

man my childhood seems so counter intuitive to me. i didn't read a fiction book till i was in my mid teens. i wasn't raised overtly male/masculine. what was stressed was independence.

trying to letting people in. socialize, and not come off really weird was a large portion of my college experience.  though a part of me will always be the sperg that wants to talk about insects, or physics; over interpersonal relationships."
"180","but word"
"181","why do i love that you said ""oopsie doodle"" lmaoooo"
"182","i know this is an old video but i will comment anyway since i have only recently discovered your channel. i majored in history for my undergrad. i have always found the disconnect between sexual expression and society fascinating. i studied pornography and discovered things like harris' list and films like bedtime for the bride that debuted literally months after the first public showing of films. i took a class that was titled sexual history in the united states. 

coincidentally this is about when the shit storm was being thrown at anita sarkeesian. for my last research paper for the class my professor wanted something relatively modern. i just so happened to know of a game called custer's revenge that created quite a stir. i only knew it existed and that people were pissed. after showing my professor the clip i got the go ahead to write it. 

i was definitely on the negative side of the conversation of everything i loved was sexist and awful. i dismissed the criticism entirely and was openly hostile toward it. what did i learn writing that paper about custer's revenge? that women had been saying things like this for decades but only now were being listened to. that was eye opening for me. it made me change my entire perspective on the whole debate and it made me shut my mouth and listen when these people were talking and telling their stories. it had me reflecting on the class as a whole and people saying the same thing about movies, photography, personal letters, politics there was just sexism bloody everywhere now. arguments being made now had been made so many decades ago and no one cared. it blew my mind a bit honestly. i feel i came out of that class a better person and i will be forever grateful to that professor."

i can totally sympathise with that, if it was possible i'd be invisible."
"186","it's interesting to see that most of these videos counteracting the shitlords  are made by people who once believed those things and have sometimes done some pretty bad things themselves. i felt a bit helpless in the face of all the videos i was getting in my suggestions after subscribing to feminist frequency. i didn't even watch them because i knew it would be so much bullshit and i would feel i had to do something but i had other things to deal with and felt i was just asking for a whole load more trolling. i guess the pushback against them had to come from people who knew the way these people thought, and who know about making youtube videos. i've been making videos for years and still haven't bothered to get round to learning to edit beyond a bit off the front and a bit off the back. mind you i'm mainly just into martial arts, i just do the video thing as an extension of that and tend to think it's much better to spend my time training than editing. i think people of my age tend to think it's up journalists in respectable publications to take on this kind of shit, except they don't make youtube videos on the whole, plus tbh they are often a bit pro establishment and i don't feel they really are that thoughtful or understanding of what's going on with problems like this. they're mostly too busy pretending to be thoughtful about why trans people are just confused and really shouldn't be allowed in women's spaces or telling young people they shouldn't eat avocado toast and jeremy corbyn is definitely anti semitic, this comment on this picture they dragged up from some random post on facebook from years ago totally proves it. they certainly aren't prepared to try to get to grips with stuff like this."

"207","i was never an anti-sjw, mostly because i was exposed to feminism on a very early age and the idea instantly resonated with me. but it is true that i've changed my views on feminism a lot, as i'm becoming more and more educated on the subject. i am finding out which type of feminist i am, and what i stand for, and i guess you could describe it as an awakening of sorts."
"208","i must admit i have not informed myself on feminist ideology, agenda and the reasoning behind it. so, if what i'm going to say is very naive or ignorant, please, don't crucify me for it, i'm here to learn.

anyways, i just don't get it, like, what's wrong with being visually drawn to the aesthetics of a person? when i'm out and about, some biological mechanism will kick in at some point, and my eyes will get drawn to some key stimulus. once my eyes rest on something, i may not even be aware of it. if i become aware of it, and if like the aesthetics of what i see, i will take a moment to enjoy the sight and move on.
i can enjoy the sight of someone's stunning eyes or beautiful smile, or someone's phenomenal tattoo or hairstyle or make-up or fashion, or the sight of a cute baby, or a puppy or a kitten, or a tasty cake on display in a bakery, and so on. i assume looking at these things i listed is considered acceptable, but appreciating the beauty of someone's physique is not acceptable? i can appreciate and enjoy the beautiful features of a person without sexualizing, but should i stop doing that regardless? why? please, someone explain."

"217","i haven't seen/read 50 shades, but from what i understand talking with people in the bdsm community who hate it, their problems don't seem to be with the villain being sexist, but that the overall story is ignorant about bdsm in general and misrepresents it. not that this is necessarily correct, but might add more context to the argument."
"218","me: why is this age restricted?
me right as the video starts: oh..."
"219","it is weird seeing her man phase"
"220","like you were saying your pop feminism video, feminism has taken over mainstream society and i don't know what it all means anymore.  

i was what i would call an armchair feminist in college, like most other ciswomen who generally cared about women's rights but hadn't read much feminist theory literature.  then under the influence of a fairly misogynistic ex boyfriend, i was introduced to karen straughan videos (she's an anti-feminist who's somewhat infamous on the internet for ""dismantling"" and speaking out against feminism even though she's a woman).  then i was jordan pertersonified, and took the red pill (watched the documentary).  

i disagree with what seem to be  the fundamental tennants of feminism, and therefore, don't think i can call myself a feminist.  i would never deny that sexism and gender bias against women has always existed and still does, and that this has affected society in ways that has given men more of the power overall (which is why i suppose we continue to talk about the ""patriarchy"").  but i don't think feminists' analysis of social issues is remotely nuanced enough, and find that a lot of modern feminism is toxic and misandric.  i also think much of history has been reframed and is now viewed through a biased, radical feminist perspective.  i guess my main problem is that i haven't been exposed to enough moderate feminists, and certainly none that can debate rationally.  so, i don't know exactly what modern feminism even is, at its core.  

the defining outcome of first wave feminism was the vote.  for second wave feminism, it was giving women more reproductive rights through the pill and roe vs wade, as well as career options and respect.  what is the focus of third wave feminism?  

i know this is a tall order, but i would love to see you make a comprehensive video on feminist theory and the history of gender politics and the women's rights movement."

it's like, i either have to say shakespeare had nothing particularly special or universal or amazing to say in his plays because being white and male isn't particularly special or universal or amazing, or that white male literature is some of the best literature on the planet, feeding a white supremacist narrative. and if the case is that shakespeare did have truly universally human things to say and he was able to do it because hes white and male, then why would i even care to read it as ""white male"" literature? why not just extract the universal themes and treat the white maleness as it should be treated everyday: irrelevant to a person's ideas."

"282","i know this is an old video but i will comment anyway since i have only recently discovered your channel. i majored in history for my undergrad. i have always found the disconnect between sexual expression and society fascinating. i studied pornography and discovered things like harris' list and films like bedtime for the bride that debuted literally months after the first public showing of films. i took a class that was titled sexual history in the united states. 

coincidentally this is about when the shit storm was being thrown at anita sarkeesian. for my last research paper for the class my professor wanted something relatively modern. i just so happened to know of a game called custer's revenge that created quite a stir. i only knew it existed and that people were pissed. after showing my professor the clip i got the go ahead to write it. 

i was definitely on the negative side of the conversation of everything i loved was sexist and awful. i dismissed the criticism entirely and was openly hostile toward it. what did i learn writing that paper about custer's revenge? that women had been saying things like this for decades but only now were being listened to. that was eye opening for me. it made me change my entire perspective on the whole debate and it made me shut my mouth and listen when these people were talking and telling their stories. it had me reflecting on the class as a whole and people saying the same thing about movies, photography, personal letters, politics there was just sexism bloody everywhere now. arguments being made now had been made so many decades ago and no one cared. it blew my mind a bit honestly. i feel i came out of that class a better person and i will be forever grateful to that professor."

"299","it seems i love your mind now but would've had several disagreements in the past. good for you, but stop calling yourself an sjw, you aren't one. you're and advocate for what's right, as youve demonstrated in several of your videos. recognize that being american is about standing for what's right, not for what you feel is right. this is exceedingly difficult to differentiate, but still possible by saying simple words: ""i don't know"" and ""i was wrong about _____."" having reasons removed from logical fallacies is important to the health of ones ethics....""without rules, we'd be up in trees flinging crap at each other"" - red"

"306","i have remained a feminist throughout the misled hate against feminazis we've gotten cuz it's all about good stuff, not bad stuff, so why be against it? ignorance, awaaaaaaay!"
"307","i was never an anti-sjw, mostly because i was exposed to feminism on a very early age and the idea instantly resonated with me. but it is true that i've changed my views on feminism a lot, as i'm becoming more and more educated on the subject. i am finding out which type of feminist i am, and what i stand for, and i guess you could describe it as an awakening of sorts."
"308","i must admit i have not informed myself on feminist ideology, agenda and the reasoning behind it. so, if what i'm going to say is very naive or ignorant, please, don't crucify me for it, i'm here to learn.

anyways, i just don't get it, like, what's wrong with being visually drawn to the aesthetics of a person? when i'm out and about, some biological mechanism will kick in at some point, and my eyes will get drawn to some key stimulus. once my eyes rest on something, i may not even be aware of it. if i become aware of it, and if like the aesthetics of what i see, i will take a moment to enjoy the sight and move on.
i can enjoy the sight of someone's stunning eyes or beautiful smile, or someone's phenomenal tattoo or hairstyle or make-up or fashion, or the sight of a cute baby, or a puppy or a kitten, or a tasty cake on display in a bakery, and so on. i assume looking at these things i listed is considered acceptable, but appreciating the beauty of someone's physique is not acceptable? i can appreciate and enjoy the beautiful features of a person without sexualizing, but should i stop doing that regardless? why? please, someone explain."

"317","i haven't seen/read 50 shades, but from what i understand talking with people in the bdsm community who hate it, their problems don't seem to be with the villain being sexist, but that the overall story is ignorant about bdsm in general and misrepresents it. not that this is necessarily correct, but might add more context to the argument."
"318","me: why is this age restricted?
me right as the video starts: oh..."
"319","it is weird seeing her man phase"
"320","like you were saying your pop feminism video, feminism has taken over mainstream society and i don't know what it all means anymore.  

i was what i would call an armchair feminist in college, like most other ciswomen who generally cared about women's rights but hadn't read much feminist theory literature.  then under the influence of a fairly misogynistic ex boyfriend, i was introduced to karen straughan videos (she's an anti-feminist who's somewhat infamous on the internet for ""dismantling"" and speaking out against feminism even though she's a woman).  then i was jordan pertersonified, and took the red pill (watched the documentary).  

i disagree with what seem to be  the fundamental tennants of feminism, and therefore, don't think i can call myself a feminist.  i would never deny that sexism and gender bias against women has always existed and still does, and that this has affected society in ways that has given men more of the power overall (which is why i suppose we continue to talk about the ""patriarchy"").  but i don't think feminists' analysis of social issues is remotely nuanced enough, and find that a lot of modern feminism is toxic and misandric.  i also think much of history has been reframed and is now viewed through a biased, radical feminist perspective.  i guess my main problem is that i haven't been exposed to enough moderate feminists, and certainly none that can debate rationally.  so, i don't know exactly what modern feminism even is, at its core.  

the defining outcome of first wave feminism was the vote.  for second wave feminism, it was giving women more reproductive rights through the pill and roe vs wade, as well as career options and respect.  what is the focus of third wave feminism?  

i know this is a tall order, but i would love to see you make a comprehensive video on feminist theory and the history of gender politics and the women's rights movement."
"321","aw man i look at the tiles. fuck."
"322","you just took all of the implied sexual undertones of how to basic and made them profoundly disturbing"
"323","looking is not the problem. fucking straight up leering is the problem. having a glance at a good looking person is something we all enjoy. when a woman catches you staring at her (first of all, don't do that) the proper reaction is to immediately look down at your shoes and mind your business. i find the way my partner checks out girls extremely cute. his eyes start darting around like he's trying to follow the path of a bee; because a) i'm sitting right there and he has some god damn manners, and b) he doesn't leer at women cause he has some god damn manners."
"324","just college converted you into believing this fever dream-esq world view that makes you ashamed of your natrual human urges to be attracted to the female body? yeah, i'm just gonna go to trade school."

"335","i would definitely consider myself a feminist, but i was a sjw for 3 months and the people i met were the worst, most self-centered, and the most mindless people i have met. i still like the ideals sjw stand for and support the ideas, but i just can never get behind being a sjw again or approving of the whole sjw movement."
"336","are men just more visual creatures than women? i get why catcalling is wrong, but it's difficult for me to understand why it's wrong that you looked at the woman's nice legs on the subway. i ""check out"" men all the time (i am a gay man), and i presume that everybody ""checks out"" strangers they find attractive. the key is to be subtle and try not to make anyone uncomfortable. but how is this act of seeing in itself sexist? do women never do it?"

"350","i had a ""feminist"" guy friend mock the idea of romance novels and my wanting to read them. what women like is generally considered childish or stupid while what men like is sophisticated and high art."
"351","it's not sexist to look at people tho... if someone goes out in public, they're agreeing to let people look at them. they choose what they get to show to the world. none of it is yours to touch or talk about, and it certainly doesn't give anyone the excuse to sexually harass or assault someone no matter what they're wearing, but by going out in a short skirt or whatever you're giving everyone around you the right to look at your legs. same goes for everybody, no matter what gender or other criteria."

"353","this is cancer"
"354","i am enjoying these videos - there are topics out there i want to know a bit more about, but they are disturbing and i am basically a fragile little bean who gets scared by the people and upset by the scope of it all. you are super funny and i don't hate myself when i watch your videos, which is a good sign."

"356","the horrid crime of finding someone attractive ...*flogs self*"
"357","pride and prejudice is, i just saw the movie, is actually feminist because the point of view from a rather indepenent women for its time, but has her question her point of view as well, that you cant believe first assumptions, that the guy is guilty of that, as is she because the guy had actually good and even noble intentions she didnt knew. and that both are terrible at comunicating that.and its not a the woman is automaticly right and surpressed point of view, and same for her love interest guy.. that the system itself is lawed but men are not the enemy. the women counting the men on their wealth is a nice touch too. but again just saw the movie.

that is what feminism shouild be, about equal treatment."
"358","your description of trying to figure out what to look at is something i deal with every day, thanks to autism."
"359","i thought the 'glancing' type strategy is what most people force themselves into who do not blatantly and antisocially stare or are utterly disinterested. similar to this ""oh no it must look like i'm staring, lets just focus on this interesting tree 20 cm to the left, i'm innocent""-kind of behaviour. i'm not sure if that's problematic, but my reaction to blatant staring has just always been to stare back until the person gets visibly uncomfortable and finally stops staring. i don't feel like it's a problem when people briefly look at my boobs once or twice. but i also think people usually don't have much self awareness if it isn't taught. so i guess it's not too bad if women show reactions to what i really like to call antisocial staring, as long as they are in an environment that is considered safe... so what i'm saying is, we kind of have to all work together to eventually all have our fair share of anxiety, glancing and personal awareness."
"360","what's wrong with looking at women's legs which are dressed in a way to attract looks, and give sexual arousal. i love when the women look at my hands or my strong hands lol and imagine shit. that's the only reason why i go to the gym. and still am pissed how that kind of a moments doesn't happen more often. it is natural to try to attract. and yes there is something about women being objectified, but thats what most of the women wants and enyoj, and expect from men. almost every women i have been with loved that, some hated that i was not doing it more, more mucalin, while i was just afraid to be an asshole coz i general i am a kind person."
"361","i want to point out that the subway rider with the hot legs wasn't merely looking back at you (unless you were already crossdressing then and a potential rival). she was looking back at the person who was looking at her body. that's what she was scanning for. she was seeing herself being seen. didn't you read berger's book?"
"362","god, i love this"
"363","i've looked at so many tiles. i fucking love tiles."
"364","i was a straight cis fem misogynist teen too. dismissing women and anything feminine is exceptionally pervasive and so becomes deeply ingrained without kids realizing or being able to process it. some people are just able to go their whole lives without the awareness, strength, independence of thought or empathy to ever consider that their programming isn't the same thing as truth."

i disagree with what seem to be  the fundamental tennants of feminism, and therefore, don't think i can call myself a feminist.  i would never deny that sexism and gender bias against women has always existed and still does, and that this has affected society in ways that has given men more of the power overall (which is why i suppose we continue to talk about the ""patriarchy"").  but i don't think feminists' analysis of social issues is remotely nuanced enough, and find that a lot of modern feminism is toxic and misandric.  i also think much of history has been reframed and is now viewed through a biased, radical feminist perspective.  i guess my main problem is that i haven't been exposed to enough moderate feminists, and certainly none that can debate rationally.  so, i don't know exactly what modern feminism even is, at its core.

"436","are men just more visual creatures than women? i get why catcalling is wrong, but it's difficult for me to understand why it's wrong that you looked at the woman's nice legs on the subway. i ""check out"" men all the time (i am a gay man), and i presume that everybody ""checks out"" strangers they find attractive. the key is to be subtle and try not to make anyone uncomfortable. but how is this act of seeing in itself sexist? do women never do it?"

"451","it's not sexist to look at people tho... if someone goes out in public, they're agreeing to let people look at them. they choose what they get to show to the world. none of it is yours to touch or talk about, and it certainly doesn't give anyone the excuse to sexually harass or assault someone no matter what they're wearing, but by going out in a short skirt or whatever you're giving everyone around you the right to look at your legs. same goes for everybody, no matter what gender or other criteria."

"457","pride and prejudice is, i just saw the movie, is actually feminist because the point of view from a rather indepenent women for its time, but has her question her point of view as well, that you cant believe first assumptions, that the guy is guilty of that, as is she because the guy had actually good and even noble intentions she didnt knew. and that both are terrible at comunicating that.and its not a the woman is automaticly right and surpressed point of view, and same for her love interest guy.. that the system itself is lawed but men are not the enemy. the women counting the men on their wealth is a nice touch too. but again just saw the movie.

that is what feminism shouild be, about equal treatment."
"458","your description of trying to figure out what to look at is something i deal with every day, thanks to autism."
"459","i thought the 'glancing' type strategy is what most people force themselves into who do not blatantly and antisocially stare or are utterly disinterested. similar to this ""oh no it must look like i'm staring, lets just focus on this interesting tree 20 cm to the left, i'm innocent""-kind of behaviour. i'm not sure if that's problematic, but my reaction to blatant staring has just always been to stare back until the person gets visibly uncomfortable and finally stops staring. i don't feel like it's a problem when people briefly look at my boobs once or twice. but i also think people usually don't have much self awareness if it isn't taught. so i guess it's not too bad if women show reactions to what i really like to call antisocial staring, as long as they are in an environment that is considered safe... so what i'm saying is, we kind of have to all work together to eventually all have our fair share of anxiety, glancing and personal awareness."
"460","what's wrong with looking at women's legs which are dressed in a way to attract looks, and give sexual arousal. i love when the women look at my hands or my strong hands lol and imagine shit. that's the only reason why i go to the gym. and still am pissed how that kind of a moments doesn't happen more often. it is natural to try to attract. and yes there is something about women being objectified, but thats what most of the women wants and enyoj, and expect from men. almost every women i have been with loved that, some hated that i was not doing it more, more mucalin, while i was just afraid to be an asshole coz i general i am a kind person."
"461","i want to point out that the subway rider with the hot legs wasn't merely looking back at you (unless you were already crossdressing then and a potential rival). she was looking back at the person who was looking at her body. that's what she was scanning for. she was seeing herself being seen. didn't you read berger's book?"
"462","god, i love this"

"472","as a (cis)woman and a feminist, i have to say, i think catcalling is gross, i think staring is gross, but people look at people. all the time. every day. we tend to look longer at the things we find attractive.   you like women's legs, i like men's arms, and women's butts, especially when they're the shapes we like. we look. if we have some social skills we don't stare. we never catcall, because ew. we can be feminists and human at the same time, i think. i hope."
"473","i'll apologise if they notice 'cause it is somewhat creepy, but i shamelessly, and blatantly, look at butts....i like women; and lookin' don't hurt... women do this to other women or attractive men...so sorry, not sorry. can't help what i like."
"474","god your makeup really is bad in this video"
"475","yeah it kind of grates on me when far leftists dismiss something as ""borgeois spectacle"". i just roll my eyes."
"476","you say the white male perspective isn't bad, but then what is it? why is it so prevalent and other perspectives aren't? isn't the logical next step that the white male perspective is oppressive and corrupt and promoting it's own superiority? that's the slope that worries me about that line of thinking. it has to come with a low res narrative about history and the world we live in today that seems self destructive.

it's like, i either have to say shakespeare had nothing particularly special or universal or amazing to say in his plays because being white and male isn't particularly special or universal or amazing, or that white male literature is some of the best literature on the planet, feeding a white supremacist narrative. and if the case is that shakespeare did have truly universally human things to say and he was able to do it because hes white and male, then why would i even care to read it as ""white male"" literature? why not just extract the universal themes and treat the white maleness as it should be treated everyday: irrelevant to a person's ideas."

"478","i think you changed your mind again on this book berger thing, please update the description a second time"
"479","i wouldn't consider this a story about becoming an sjw. just a story about becoming a decent human being. and a story about looking at the tile.

good to see you came around. i hope you inspire a lot of people to realize the same.

man my childhood seems so counter intuitive to me. i didn't read a fiction book till i was in my mid teens. i wasn't raised overtly male/masculine. what was stressed was independence.

trying to letting people in. socialize, and not come off really weird was a large portion of my college experience.  though a part of me will always be the sperg that wants to talk about insects, or physics; over interpersonal relationships."
"480","but word"
"481","why do i love that you said ""oopsie doodle"" lmaoooo"
"482","i know this is an old video but i will comment anyway since i have only recently discovered your channel. i majored in history for my undergrad. i have always found the disconnect between sexual expression and society fascinating. i studied pornography and discovered things like harris' list and films like bedtime for the bride that debuted literally months after the first public showing of films. i took a class that was titled sexual history in the united states. 

coincidentally this is about when the shit storm was being thrown at anita sarkeesian. for my last research paper for the class my professor wanted something relatively modern. i just so happened to know of a game called custer's revenge that created quite a stir. i only knew it existed and that people were pissed. after showing my professor the clip i got the go ahead to write it. 

i was definitely on the negative side of the conversation of everything i loved was sexist and awful. i dismissed the criticism entirely and was openly hostile toward it. what did i learn writing that paper about custer's revenge? that women had been saying things like this for decades but only now were being listened to. that was eye opening for me. it made me change my entire perspective on the whole debate and it made me shut my mouth and listen when these people were talking and telling their stories. it had me reflecting on the class as a whole and people saying the same thing about movies, photography, personal letters, politics there was just sexism bloody everywhere now. arguments being made now had been made so many decades ago and no one cared. it blew my mind a bit honestly. i feel i came out of that class a better person and i will be forever grateful to that professor."
"483","you know i actually like your videos a lot more post transition. you seem a lot more chill. the first video i saw was the one about incels abd was pretty stunned when you mentioned you were trans"

"485","i'm so glad i'm not the only one who figured out that women hate being looked at by other people.
i can totally sympathise with that, if it was possible i'd be invisible."
"486","it's interesting to see that most of these videos counteracting the shitlords  are made by people who once believed those things and have sometimes done some pretty bad things themselves. i felt a bit helpless in the face of all the videos i was getting in my suggestions after subscribing to feminist frequency. i didn't even watch them because i knew it would be so much bullshit and i would feel i had to do something but i had other things to deal with and felt i was just asking for a whole load more trolling. i guess the pushback against them had to come from people who knew the way these people thought, and who know about making youtube videos. i've been making videos for years and still haven't bothered to get round to learning to edit beyond a bit off the front and a bit off the back. mind you i'm mainly just into martial arts, i just do the video thing as an extension of that and tend to think it's much better to spend my time training than editing. i think people of my age tend to think it's up journalists in respectable publications to take on this kind of shit, except they don't make youtube videos on the whole, plus tbh they are often a bit pro establishment and i don't feel they really are that thoughtful or understanding of what's going on with problems like this. they're mostly too busy pretending to be thoughtful about why trans people are just confused and really shouldn't be allowed in women's spaces or telling young people they shouldn't eat avocado toast and jeremy corbyn is definitely anti semitic, this comment on this picture they dragged up from some random post on facebook from years ago totally proves it. they certainly aren't prepared to try to get to grips with stuff like this."
"487","""tell me i'm a feminist! tell me i'm a nice guy you god damn bitch!"""
"488","❤️❤️"
"489","i don't quite understand this confronting people about looking at you. i try not to stare or be too obvious about it, but if there is something to see, i'll look. in case of this woman the proper answer would be probably: it was not me who dressed you that way, it was you who picked the clothes that reveal your legs because you know they look very nice and you want to show them off - but somehow i'm at fault for looking at them? screw that. what's on display, i'll look at. if you don't want people looking at any part of your body, cover it up."

"530","i don't see anything problematic about appropriating feminism in order to be more attractive to potential partners.   i'm confident this is how contemporary feminism decided that prostitution is cool and empowering."
"531","i know this is veryyy serious but.. ""i was looking at the goddamn tile, wendy!"" is giving me hives."
"532","it's a sad world when contrapoints is the smartest sjw on youtube.  it's a sad world when the smartest skeptic on youtube is . . . fuck."

"534","wait, what's wrong with looking at beautiful bodies in public? i consider myself an sjw, and a feminist, but i haven't yet understood this point. consider a lesbian checking out a woman. please explain, i'm open to changing my perspective."
"535","i would definitely consider myself a feminist, but i was a sjw for 3 months and the people i met were the worst, most self-centered, and the most mindless people i have met. i still like the ideals sjw stand for and support the ideas, but i just can never get behind being a sjw again or approving of the whole sjw movement."
"536","are men just more visual creatures than women? i get why catcalling is wrong, but it's difficult for me to understand why it's wrong that you looked at the woman's nice legs on the subway. i ""check out"" men all the time (i am a gay man), and i presume that everybody ""checks out"" strangers they find attractive. the key is to be subtle and try not to make anyone uncomfortable. but how is this act of seeing in itself sexist? do women never do it?"
"537","i transitioned from brocialist to marxist sjw. i feel better now."

"543","i'm a black female conservative leaning weeb and i have to say that i fucking



love your vids. you, unlike most """"""sjws"""""" don't use buzzfeed buzz words and passive-aggressive insults to get your points across. did i mention that i liked you?"
"544","you're so lovely <3"
"545","i love them so much tbh"
"546","why can't i look at beautiful women, when women often look at beautiful males.... i mean, it's not on purpose.
it's not like a give a creepy stare or something.... i just tend to notice how good she looks.... so,
what's wrong with that?"
"547","omg. when did this become age restricted? :/"
"548","hahahahaha 😂 loved the 50 shades of grey displayed carelessly in the back 😂"
"549","and the i ended up like this. the end. lol"
"550","i had a ""feminist"" guy friend mock the idea of romance novels and my wanting to read them. what women like is generally considered childish or stupid while what men like is sophisticated and high art."
"551","it's not sexist to look at people tho... if someone goes out in public, they're agreeing to let people look at them. they choose what they get to show to the world. none of it is yours to touch or talk about, and it certainly doesn't give anyone the excuse to sexually harass or assault someone no matter what they're wearing, but by going out in a short skirt or whatever you're giving everyone around you the right to look at your legs. same goes for everybody, no matter what gender or other criteria."

"556","the horrid crime of finding someone attractive ...*flogs self*"
"557","pride and prejudice is, i just saw the movie, is actually feminist because the point of view from a rather indepenent women for its time, but has her question her point of view as well, that you cant believe first assumptions, that the guy is guilty of that, as is she because the guy had actually good and even noble intentions she didnt knew. and that both are terrible at comunicating that.and its not a the woman is automaticly right and surpressed point of view, and same for her love interest guy.. that the system itself is lawed but men are not the enemy. the women counting the men on their wealth is a nice touch too. but again just saw the movie.

that is what feminism shouild be, about equal treatment."
"558","your description of trying to figure out what to look at is something i deal with every day, thanks to autism."
"559","i thought the 'glancing' type strategy is what most people force themselves into who do not blatantly and antisocially stare or are utterly disinterested. similar to this ""oh no it must look like i'm staring, lets just focus on this interesting tree 20 cm to the left, i'm innocent""-kind of behaviour. i'm not sure if that's problematic, but my reaction to blatant staring has just always been to stare back until the person gets visibly uncomfortable and finally stops staring. i don't feel like it's a problem when people briefly look at my boobs once or twice. but i also think people usually don't have much self awareness if it isn't taught. so i guess it's not too bad if women show reactions to what i really like to call antisocial staring, as long as they are in an environment that is considered safe... so what i'm saying is, we kind of have to all work together to eventually all have our fair share of anxiety, glancing and personal awareness."
"560","what's wrong with looking at women's legs which are dressed in a way to attract looks, and give sexual arousal. i love when the women look at my hands or my strong hands lol and imagine shit. that's the only reason why i go to the gym. and still am pissed how that kind of a moments doesn't happen more often. it is natural to try to attract. and yes there is something about women being objectified, but thats what most of the women wants and enyoj, and expect from men. almost every women i have been with loved that, some hated that i was not doing it more, more mucalin, while i was just afraid to be an asshole coz i general i am a kind person."
"561","i want to point out that the subway rider with the hot legs wasn't merely looking back at you (unless you were already crossdressing then and a potential rival). she was looking back at the person who was looking at her body. that's what she was scanning for. she was seeing herself being seen. didn't you read berger's book?"
"562","god, i love this"
"563","i've looked at so many tiles. i fucking love tiles."
"564","i was a straight cis fem misogynist teen too. dismissing women and anything feminine is exceptionally pervasive and so becomes deeply ingrained without kids realizing or being able to process it. some people are just able to go their whole lives without the awareness, strength, independence of thought or empathy to ever consider that their programming isn't the same thing as truth."

"570","ok so you can't look at people nowadays?"
"571","i know this is old and it's off topic, but i hope her makeup skills improved , especially that contour!!!"
"572","as a (cis)woman and a feminist, i have to say, i think catcalling is gross, i think staring is gross, but people look at people. all the time. every day. we tend to look longer at the things we find attractive.   you like women's legs, i like men's arms, and women's butts, especially when they're the shapes we like. we look. if we have some social skills we don't stare. we never catcall, because ew. we can be feminists and human at the same time, i think. i hope."
"573","i'll apologise if they notice 'cause it is somewhat creepy, but i shamelessly, and blatantly, look at butts....i like women; and lookin' don't hurt... women do this to other women or attractive men...so sorry, not sorry. can't help what i like."
"574","god your makeup really is bad in this video"
"575","yeah it kind of grates on me when far leftists dismiss something as ""borgeois spectacle"". i just roll my eyes."
"576","you say the white male perspective isn't bad, but then what is it? why is it so prevalent and other perspectives aren't? isn't the logical next step that the white male perspective is oppressive and corrupt and promoting it's own superiority? that's the slope that worries me about that line of thinking. it has to come with a low res narrative about history and the world we live in today that seems self destructive.

it's like, i either have to say shakespeare had nothing particularly special or universal or amazing to say in his plays because being white and male isn't particularly special or universal or amazing, or that white male literature is some of the best literature on the planet, feeding a white supremacist narrative. and if the case is that shakespeare did have truly universally human things to say and he was able to do it because hes white and male, then why would i even care to read it as ""white male"" literature? why not just extract the universal themes and treat the white maleness as it should be treated everyday: irrelevant to a person's ideas."
"577","midnight, the stars, and that outro. bravo"
"578","i think you changed your mind again on this book berger thing, please update the description a second time"
"579","i wouldn't consider this a story about becoming an sjw. just a story about becoming a decent human being. and a story about looking at the tile.

good to see you came around. i hope you inspire a lot of people to realize the same.

man my childhood seems so counter intuitive to me. i didn't read a fiction book till i was in my mid teens. i wasn't raised overtly male/masculine. what was stressed was independence.

trying to letting people in. socialize, and not come off really weird was a large portion of my college experience.  though a part of me will always be the sperg that wants to talk about insects, or physics; over interpersonal relationships."
"580","but word"
"581","why do i love that you said ""oopsie doodle"" lmaoooo"
"582","i know this is an old video but i will comment anyway since i have only recently discovered your channel. i majored in history for my undergrad. i have always found the disconnect between sexual expression and society fascinating. i studied pornography and discovered things like harris' list and films like bedtime for the bride that debuted literally months after the first public showing of films. i took a class that was titled sexual history in the united states. 

coincidentally this is about when the shit storm was being thrown at anita sarkeesian. for my last research paper for the class my professor wanted something relatively modern. i just so happened to know of a game called custer's revenge that created quite a stir. i only knew it existed and that people were pissed. after showing my professor the clip i got the go ahead to write it. 

i was definitely on the negative side of the conversation of everything i loved was sexist and awful. i dismissed the criticism entirely and was openly hostile toward it. what did i learn writing that paper about custer's revenge? that women had been saying things like this for decades but only now were being listened to. that was eye opening for me. it made me change my entire perspective on the whole debate and it made me shut my mouth and listen when these people were talking and telling their stories. it had me reflecting on the class as a whole and people saying the same thing about movies, photography, personal letters, politics there was just sexism bloody everywhere now. arguments being made now had been made so many decades ago and no one cared. it blew my mind a bit honestly. i feel i came out of that class a better person and i will be forever grateful to that professor."
"583","you know i actually like your videos a lot more post transition. you seem a lot more chill. the first video i saw was the one about incels abd was pretty stunned when you mentioned you were trans"
"584","""i can't sleep for more than two hours at a time, and i do not get erections anymore, but apart from that it's fine."" ahh yes. ssris. my nemesis."
"585","i'm so glad i'm not the only one who figured out that women hate being looked at by other people.
i can totally sympathise with that, if it was possible i'd be invisible."
"586","it's interesting to see that most of these videos counteracting the shitlords  are made by people who once believed those things and have sometimes done some pretty bad things themselves. i felt a bit helpless in the face of all the videos i was getting in my suggestions after subscribing to feminist frequency. i didn't even watch them because i knew it would be so much bullshit and i would feel i had to do something but i had other things to deal with and felt i was just asking for a whole load more trolling. i guess the pushback against them had to come from people who knew the way these people thought, and who know about making youtube videos. i've been making videos for years and still haven't bothered to get round to learning to edit beyond a bit off the front and a bit off the back. mind you i'm mainly just into martial arts, i just do the video thing as an extension of that and tend to think it's much better to spend my time training than editing. i think people of my age tend to think it's up journalists in respectable publications to take on this kind of shit, except they don't make youtube videos on the whole, plus tbh they are often a bit pro establishment and i don't feel they really are that thoughtful or understanding of what's going on with problems like this. they're mostly too busy pretending to be thoughtful about why trans people are just confused and really shouldn't be allowed in women's spaces or telling young people they shouldn't eat avocado toast and jeremy corbyn is definitely anti semitic, this comment on this picture they dragged up from some random post on facebook from years ago totally proves it. they certainly aren't prepared to try to get to grips with stuff like this."
"587","""tell me i'm a feminist! tell me i'm a nice guy you god damn bitch!"""
"588","❤️❤️"
"589","i don't quite understand this confronting people about looking at you. i try not to stare or be too obvious about it, but if there is something to see, i'll look. in case of this woman the proper answer would be probably: it was not me who dressed you that way, it was you who picked the clothes that reveal your legs because you know they look very nice and you want to show them off - but somehow i'm at fault for looking at them? screw that. what's on display, i'll look at. if you don't want people looking at any part of your body, cover it up."

"599","it seems i love your mind now but would've had several disagreements in the past. good for you, but stop calling yourself an sjw, you aren't one. you're and advocate for what's right, as youve demonstrated in several of your videos. recognize that being american is about standing for what's right, not for what you feel is right. this is exceedingly difficult to differentiate, but still possible by saying simple words: ""i don't know"" and ""i was wrong about _____."" having reasons removed from logical fallacies is important to the health of ones ethics....""without rules, we'd be up in trees flinging crap at each other"" - red"

"608","from what it sounds like, you really toured the wrong corners of philosophy given your interests. the topics/schools you're describing all seem to be in the continental and/or historical corner of philosophy. 

unfortunately, analytic philosophy (broadly construed) is arguably the only subschool of philosophy serious about finding out how the world works from a broadly naturalistic and scientific perspective. had you had the chance to study philosophical logic, philosophy of language, contemporary ethics, the philosophy of quantum mechanics, or contemporary analytic philosophy of mind, instead of derrida, foucault, or aristotle, maybe you wouldn't have lost your patience with philosophy so quickly."

"634","in my first year as a history grad student and you are totally right about the specificity. i love history and i tend to be drawn towards lgbt history since that is a smaller field and there tends to be more to uncover/write about than other historical topics. the thing is that i have no idea how to add something new to the literature. gayle rubin, who i used a lot in my senior thesis, seems to have covered every aspect of gay history in the bay area that i was interested in writing about."
"635","well the problem with phd's is that for such a highly regarded and difficult to acquire thing, you would expect to have a holistic understanding of the field but you end up knowing just one aspect of it, and if you choose  the wrong area of study, you just wasted 6 years studying something that was debunked but still dont have practical intellectual authority over the broader field. having the phd in your name can grant you social and administrative authority though and for me, that was enough. sometimes, the world is unfair like that.  having a phd in ______ would help people believe you more and sell books, or spread your ideas in the broader subject of _____ than if you don't have a phd in the narrower subject of ____."
"636","so you want the critical theorists to debate the libertarians, and you'll pay some money to access such a debate.  well, good news: it's been done, through exhaustive research, and resolved in favor of the libertarian position - well, some neo-aristotelian-randian synthesis: https://www.google.com/search?q=total+freedom+toward+dialectical+libertarianism . good luck going down this 'dialectical libertarian' rabbit hole complete with ridiculously large bibliographies covering all bases, and not emerging in essence a randian. ^_^  (hey, i've got that edition of adorno's aesthetic theory, too.  wish i could understand any of it. :("

"695","it's taken me four years to slog through the first two years of my degree in english, and the majority of the classes i've had that were actually relevant to my major have been taught by professors with heads so far up their asses they think the real world has functioned the same way since they were in grad school in '89. most recently, i had an intro to lit professor who, when he wasn't teaching our class the same literary analysis terminology i'd been taught in my 8th grade english class, was constantly waxing philosophical about the selected readings he'd so lovingly handpicked from an anthology that cost myself and my fellow classmates approximately $250 of the government's hard-stolen cash that was loaned to me so as to ensure i die penniless as well as alone. it's important to note that every single piece he selected from this anthology that he insisted we must have is public domain and easily accessed for free with a cursory google search. i think my favorite moment out of the whole semester was one morning when i stumbled into class approximately 3 minutes early wearing skeleton pajama pants from target, having slept through my alarm after not completing the reading out of spite. i looked over the sparknotes page so that i could have a coherent thought to offer the class because participation was a significant enough chunk of my grade that i had to at least pretend i cared, and when the professor opened up the floor for discussion and nobody gave a response because it was 8:30 in the goddamn morning, i pulled something directly out of my ass. the professor gave a thoughtful nod, then turned to the rest of the class and said, ""sarah really seems to have a solid grasp on the material, unlike the rest of you. you've got to read the assigned readings 2 or 3 times, every word, to form an argument as coherent as the one she just delivered."" academia is $120,000 sham."

also i know its an old video, but those pigtails are cute!"
"708","from what it sounds like, you really toured the wrong corners of philosophy given your interests. the topics/schools you're describing all seem to be in the continental and/or historical corner of philosophy. 

unfortunately, analytic philosophy (broadly construed) is arguably the only subschool of philosophy serious about finding out how the world works from a broadly naturalistic and scientific perspective. had you had the chance to study philosophical logic, philosophy of language, contemporary ethics, the philosophy of quantum mechanics, or contemporary analytic philosophy of mind, instead of derrida, foucault, or aristotle, maybe you wouldn't have lost your patience with philosophy so quickly."

"734","in my first year as a history grad student and you are totally right about the specificity. i love history and i tend to be drawn towards lgbt history since that is a smaller field and there tends to be more to uncover/write about than other historical topics. the thing is that i have no idea how to add something new to the literature. gayle rubin, who i used a lot in my senior thesis, seems to have covered every aspect of gay history in the bay area that i was interested in writing about."
"735","well the problem with phd's is that for such a highly regarded and difficult to acquire thing, you would expect to have a holistic understanding of the field but you end up knowing just one aspect of it, and if you choose  the wrong area of study, you just wasted 6 years studying something that was debunked but still dont have practical intellectual authority over the broader field. having the phd in your name can grant you social and administrative authority though and for me, that was enough. sometimes, the world is unfair like that.  having a phd in ______ would help people believe you more and sell books, or spread your ideas in the broader subject of _____ than if you don't have a phd in the narrower subject of ____."

unfortunately, analytic philosophy (broadly construed) is arguably the only subschool of philosophy serious about finding out how the world works from a broadly naturalistic and scientific perspective. had you had the chance to study philosophical logic, philosophy of language, contemporary ethics, the philosophy of quantum mechanics, or contemporary analytic philosophy of mind, instead of derrida, foucault, or aristotle, maybe you wouldn't have lost your patience with philosophy so quickly."

"1695","it's taken me four years to slog through the first two years of my degree in english, and the majority of the classes i've had that were actually relevant to my major have been taught by professors with heads so far up their asses they think the real world has functioned the same way since they were in grad school in '89. most recently, i had an intro to lit professor who, when he wasn't teaching our class the same literary analysis terminology i'd been taught in my 8th grade english class, was constantly waxing philosophical about the selected readings he'd so lovingly handpicked from an anthology that cost myself and my fellow classmates approximately $250 of the government's hard-stolen cash that was loaned to me so as to ensure i die penniless as well as alone. it's important to note that every single piece he selected from this anthology that he insisted we must have is public domain and easily accessed for free with a cursory google search. i think my favorite moment out of the whole semester was one morning when i stumbled into class approximately 3 minutes early wearing skeleton pajama pants from target, having slept through my alarm after not completing the reading out of spite. i looked over the sparknotes page so that i could have a coherent thought to offer the class because participation was a significant enough chunk of my grade that i had to at least pretend i cared, and when the professor opened up the floor for discussion and nobody gave a response because it was 8:30 in the goddamn morning, i pulled something directly out of my ass. the professor gave a thoughtful nod, then turned to the rest of the class and said, ""sarah really seems to have a solid grasp on the material, unlike the rest of you. you've got to read the assigned readings 2 or 3 times, every word, to form an argument as coherent as the one she just delivered."" academia is $120,000 sham."

"1708","from what it sounds like, you really toured the wrong corners of philosophy given your interests. the topics/schools you're describing all seem to be in the continental and/or historical corner of philosophy. 

unfortunately, analytic philosophy (broadly construed) is arguably the only subschool of philosophy serious about finding out how the world works from a broadly naturalistic and scientific perspective. had you had the chance to study philosophical logic, philosophy of language, contemporary ethics, the philosophy of quantum mechanics, or contemporary analytic philosophy of mind, instead of derrida, foucault, or aristotle, maybe you wouldn't have lost your patience with philosophy so quickly."

"1734","in my first year as a history grad student and you are totally right about the specificity. i love history and i tend to be drawn towards lgbt history since that is a smaller field and there tends to be more to uncover/write about than other historical topics. the thing is that i have no idea how to add something new to the literature. gayle rubin, who i used a lot in my senior thesis, seems to have covered every aspect of gay history in the bay area that i was interested in writing about."
"1735","well the problem with phd's is that for such a highly regarded and difficult to acquire thing, you would expect to have a holistic understanding of the field but you end up knowing just one aspect of it, and if you choose  the wrong area of study, you just wasted 6 years studying something that was debunked but still dont have practical intellectual authority over the broader field. having the phd in your name can grant you social and administrative authority though and for me, that was enough. sometimes, the world is unfair like that.  having a phd in ______ would help people believe you more and sell books, or spread your ideas in the broader subject of _____ than if you don't have a phd in the narrower subject of ____."

should have looked at the title more closely. unnngh *headdesk* ... especially since i haven't enjoyed a new game since gold & silver, why do i need to mega-evolve anything and who decided to plan the shopping city like a massive pokeball? why do you keep getting that part wrong?!?! sorry, i hate that one. whichever one it was. jesus, when are we getting an original grey brick gameboy rerelease, i want to use my old cartridges. /baked90skidramble"
"1848","i'm fucking dead at the bob dylan impression. you're a genius."
"1849","i had a full blown panic attack when you started talking about how everything is shit. but i still fucking love you."
"1850","this was a very exurb1a-esque video"
"1851","this is very reminiscent of the book ""we were feminists once"" by andi zeisler. i encourage anyone interested in the topic of ""pop feminism"" (or how feminism has been commodified) to read it."
"1852","thank god, i'm not the only non sexist who can't stand taylor swift. i don't mind feminism being a forefront for a music career. pink and janelle monae do it fine.  something about taylor just irks the shit out of me. idk what it is. hell, i even like katy perry an rhianna though they cant sing;their hella chill.
on pop feminism, i totally agree. how have  mra been that retarded to think that feminists aren't aware that capatalism and coporations has high jacked feminism to use for marketing skemes?"
"1853","i love you. it's okay to have to take a shit."
"1854","teach me your eyeliner wizardry"
"1855","did she delete her streams where she watched her old videos?"
"1856","2:49 oh okay"
"1857","god. i can't believe i watched so many of your videos and didn't realise you'd weirdly anti-feminist and complaining about women becoming ""masculine"" with no regard to the power imbalances which require direct and assertive behavior. if women stayed ""feminine"" they wouldn't be voting right now. instead just wanting men to be more ""feminine"" is ridiculous because they literally have social power over women no matter how they behave. saying that the assertiveness that feminists encourage women to have is ""rapey"" is an extreme, laughable, and painful reach."
"1858","feminism is the advocacy of womens rights on the grounds of social, political, and economic equality. i do not partake in advocacy or activism of any sort, so i am not a feminist, but i believe in and support equality for everyone."
"1859","my idea is to cry myself to sleep while reading schopenhauer and cioran after laughing at memes about schopenhauer and cioran."
"1860","wonderful content, thank u  💕 🤘🏼"
"1861","3.50 ""what we should be doing is turning men into women."" 

i'll be honest, before i watched a video where you said you came out as trans relatively recently, well after you started this channel, i had no idea you needed to come out."
"1862","wow i just started following you, your props and lighting has come so far but you've always been great!"
"1863","except tj kirk/the amazing atheist doesn't sit there and talk about feminism 24/7. he talks about a lot of subjects and has criticized both the left and right on plenty occasions. also, who the fuck cares how old he is? comparing him to people attacking justin bieber, who is popular among young girls, implies that feminism is something primarily for young girls when it isn't. ""those"" people like tj aren't attacking 19 year old girls, contrary to what you want to tell yourself."
"1864","its 2am cool it with the scary shit"
"1865","hello from india.  i wish that there was a ""love"" button instead of just ""like"". love your channel. my boyfriend introduced me  to it."
"1866","you are fucking brilliant!"
"1867","empty space doesn't really exist."
"1868","best bob dylan impression ever"
"1869","this is so grade a content. congrats, you're not part of the 99% of shit"
"1870","that dylanesque tay cover was amazing"
"1871","thank you for the dylan bit.  :)"
"1872","i love how you used an image of the caligula poster when you said 95% of movies are shit xd. also, can we get a full length bob dylan cover of ""trouble when you walked in?"" that was hilarious and sounded very dylan-y. it's stuck in my head now haha"
"1873","loved the sequence with the black and white films, that was hilarious but i'm also interesting in watching them, anyone know the sources?"
"1874","i love you. this is perfect."
"1875","ok but the part where you said longing for childhood and showed pokemon i actually cried i hate growing up"
"1876","more bob dylan impersonations!"
"1877","they say pop feminism and i say poop feminism"
"1878","i find those dove ads so insulting and patronizing."
"1879","......i dunno if i agree completely. i generally pretty much love your videos, but the idea that most feminism these days would somehow be complete trash....no. not really. i mean sure, pop feminism has absolutely flooded a lot of pop culture repackaging the idea of female and male equality into something someone can sell.  like dove who pretend to be all for that confidence in the countries where that sells while all in for the skin bleaching in the countries where that sells. 
still, i wouldn't deem all new age feminism to be bullshit shit out by twisted companies.
i think now we are making progress within intersectionality for example, and also the meetoo movement uncovering sexual harassment everywhere. and of course, i know i know , globally we have along way to go. and the constant focus on white rich womens issues is not really bringing help where it is most needed. still tho, i gotta say, to just bash third wave feminism alltogether probably just helps the wrong agenda. at least in my experience.
love, my name."
"1880","1:13 lol <3"
"1881","omg finally someone else agrees the ""no true scotsman fallacy"" is not a valid fallacy!!!!"
"1882","i love you"
"1883","omg. i love you so much! you make me laugh! and, of course, you're so smart!!! 🤩"
"1884","five minutes in before i noticed the framed picture. wll played."
"1885","feminism broke the first law of any cultural movement:
never become popular.

once it became popular, all the normies and power-hungry sociopaths wanted in on it.
the normies wanted an instant ""feel good about yourself"" button they could pin on their jacket, and the sociopaths love nothing more than to point at people they want to eliminate and shout words which make them go away.
words like
""traitor""
""heretic""
""jew""
""communist""
""misogynist""

thankfully, it seems to have ground to a halt before calling someone a woman hater got you insta-banned from everywhere or executed in some gulag or concentration camp."
"1886","our society doesn't reward you for being feminine, in the same way that striving to act ""masculine"" (like being a ceo etc) does. the goal up to now has been to get women a seat at the success table, and that has meant having ""masculine"" aims. it would be good to start discussing what successful femininity looks like. i'd prefer a society that isn't driven by ""getting to the top"" type aims."
"1887","3:30 i've heard it called the ""cinderella fallacy""- that we hate disney princesses as weak because their strength comes from feminine traits like compassion, which is inherently misogynistic"
"1888","you literally just explained all of existence in one video didnt you. starting to believe you are a beautiful alien being sent to earth to help get us out of the shitty mess we are in. and youve grown so much since this video i notice. proud of you!!"
"1889","i think that bob dylan shudders every time this video plays, and he's not sure why"
"1890","if our paths cross someday, i'd love to share a drink with you. keep up the great work."
"1891","like sex, even bad feminism is better than no feminism."
"1892","ahhhh yessss contrapoints you have amazing taste, at 6:48 that was a clip of dreams by akira kurosawa!! that is my personal favorite of his"
"1893","that comment about people who did videos about justin beiber all the time 
oh i used to watch so many cringe worthy ranters who were like that
thankfully i've changed my youtube subscription palette in recent years"
"1894","do you honestly believe that continue acting ""like women"" will make men act the same? they'll keep doing what they've been doing forever if they don't feel pressure. girls, eat the world."
"1895","omg there needs to be entire albums of various parody current pop songs in the voices of classic rock stars... that is the best... i'm crying laughing and i need more..."
"1896","you seem like the type to watch american horror story"
"1897","this was an amazing video!!!!"
"1898","bob dylan t-swift killed me. love it!"
"1899","agreed that it's almost seems as if modern feminism hates the idea of feminity. i don't want feminism to be completely eradicated from the earth, but i also wanna be able to wear cute pastel and frilly things!"
"1900","adding this one to my favorites. oof that second half. <3"
"1901","could you imagine if women in their thirties complained about the music teenage boys listen to. that just sounds bizarre."
"1902","that was an amazing cover btw"
"1903","turn woman into men? so ambition is a masculine trait? why are we gendering inspirational quotes? ""never take no for an answer"" is obviously meant to be understood in an appropriate context."
"1904","that final montage was genuinely beautiful. well said."

"1908","i think we should judge by dna"
"1909","all feminism is bad.. women are dumber and weaker sex.. and should submit to more intelligent and wealthier men"

"1913","♥️♥️♥️♥️ i simply love you"
"1914","i don't think that we should be telling men to be women or women to be men. we should just stop categorizing certain emotions and behaviors as female or male. everyone has the same emotions. men and women are encouraged by society to behave in different ways and display different emotions. women can be aggressive and domineering and men can cry and be nurturing. this doesn't mean that the domineering woman is acting like a man or that the nurturing man is acting like a woman. they are acting like human beings."

"1919","wow you were early on the matt lauer thing, nice."
"1920","i don't think 90% of feminism is shit because most feminists aren't out there being asshole they're busy. i think the assholes get more attention as usual. you're average student female for instance, probably believes that rape should be taken more seriously and is probably pro choice and all that, but doesn't go out of her way to yell at people for no reason."

"2047","are you as disappointed as i am about the reality of pokemon let's go p(&e)? it seemed like what we always wanted. the original pokemon game that we loved finally in proper 3d and with an actual pokeball you can use to catch pokemon??? fuck the 8 year old that has veto power over my brain was losing her shit.
should have looked at the title more closely. unnngh *headdesk* ... especially since i haven't enjoyed a new game since gold & silver, why do i need to mega-evolve anything and who decided to plan the shopping city like a massive pokeball? why do you keep getting that part wrong?!?! sorry, i hate that one. whichever one it was. jesus, when are we getting an original grey brick gameboy rerelease, i want to use my old cartridges. /baked90skidramble"
"2048","i'm fucking dead at the bob dylan impression. you're a genius."
"2049","i had a full blown panic attack when you started talking about how everything is shit. but i still fucking love you."
"2050","this was a very exurb1a-esque video"
"2051","this is very reminiscent of the book ""we were feminists once"" by andi zeisler. i encourage anyone interested in the topic of ""pop feminism"" (or how feminism has been commodified) to read it."
"2052","thank god, i'm not the only non sexist who can't stand taylor swift. i don't mind feminism being a forefront for a music career. pink and janelle monae do it fine.  something about taylor just irks the shit out of me. idk what it is. hell, i even like katy perry an rhianna though they cant sing;their hella chill.
on pop feminism, i totally agree. how have  mra been that retarded to think that feminists aren't aware that capatalism and coporations has high jacked feminism to use for marketing skemes?"
"2053","i love you. it's okay to have to take a shit."
"2054","teach me your eyeliner wizardry"
"2055","did she delete her streams where she watched her old videos?"
"2056","2:49 oh okay"
"2057","god. i can't believe i watched so many of your videos and didn't realise you'd weirdly anti-feminist and complaining about women becoming ""masculine"" with no regard to the power imbalances which require direct and assertive behavior. if women stayed ""feminine"" they wouldn't be voting right now. instead just wanting men to be more ""feminine"" is ridiculous because they literally have social power over women no matter how they behave. saying that the assertiveness that feminists encourage women to have is ""rapey"" is an extreme, laughable, and painful reach."
"2058","feminism is the advocacy of womens rights on the grounds of social, political, and economic equality. i do not partake in advocacy or activism of any sort, so i am not a feminist, but i believe in and support equality for everyone."
"2059","my idea is to cry myself to sleep while reading schopenhauer and cioran after laughing at memes about schopenhauer and cioran."
"2060","wonderful content, thank u  💕 🤘🏼"
"2061","3.50 ""what we should be doing is turning men into women."" 

i'll be honest, before i watched a video where you said you came out as trans relatively recently, well after you started this channel, i had no idea you needed to come out."
"2062","wow i just started following you, your props and lighting has come so far but you've always been great!"
"2063","except tj kirk/the amazing atheist doesn't sit there and talk about feminism 24/7. he talks about a lot of subjects and has criticized both the left and right on plenty occasions. also, who the fuck cares how old he is? comparing him to people attacking justin bieber, who is popular among young girls, implies that feminism is something primarily for young girls when it isn't. ""those"" people like tj aren't attacking 19 year old girls, contrary to what you want to tell yourself."
"2064","its 2am cool it with the scary shit"
"2065","hello from india.  i wish that there was a ""love"" button instead of just ""like"". love your channel. my boyfriend introduced me  to it."
"2066","you are fucking brilliant!"
"2067","empty space doesn't really exist."
"2068","best bob dylan impression ever"
"2069","this is so grade a content. congrats, you're not part of the 99% of shit"
"2070","that dylanesque tay cover was amazing"
"2071","thank you for the dylan bit.  :)"
"2072","i love how you used an image of the caligula poster when you said 95% of movies are shit xd. also, can we get a full length bob dylan cover of ""trouble when you walked in?"" that was hilarious and sounded very dylan-y. it's stuck in my head now haha"
"2073","loved the sequence with the black and white films, that was hilarious but i'm also interesting in watching them, anyone know the sources?"
"2074","i love you. this is perfect."
"2075","ok but the part where you said longing for childhood and showed pokemon i actually cried i hate growing up"
"2076","more bob dylan impersonations!"
"2077","they say pop feminism and i say poop feminism"
"2078","i find those dove ads so insulting and patronizing."
"2079","......i dunno if i agree completely. i generally pretty much love your videos, but the idea that most feminism these days would somehow be complete trash....no. not really. i mean sure, pop feminism has absolutely flooded a lot of pop culture repackaging the idea of female and male equality into something someone can sell.  like dove who pretend to be all for that confidence in the countries where that sells while all in for the skin bleaching in the countries where that sells. 
still, i wouldn't deem all new age feminism to be bullshit shit out by twisted companies.
i think now we are making progress within intersectionality for example, and also the meetoo movement uncovering sexual harassment everywhere. and of course, i know i know , globally we have along way to go. and the constant focus on white rich womens issues is not really bringing help where it is most needed. still tho, i gotta say, to just bash third wave feminism alltogether probably just helps the wrong agenda. at least in my experience.
love, my name."
"2080","1:13 lol <3"
"2081","omg finally someone else agrees the ""no true scotsman fallacy"" is not a valid fallacy!!!!"
"2082","i love you"
"2083","omg. i love you so much! you make me laugh! and, of course, you're so smart!!! 🤩"
"2084","five minutes in before i noticed the framed picture. wll played."
"2085","feminism broke the first law of any cultural movement:
never become popular.

once it became popular, all the normies and power-hungry sociopaths wanted in on it.
the normies wanted an instant ""feel good about yourself"" button they could pin on their jacket, and the sociopaths love nothing more than to point at people they want to eliminate and shout words which make them go away.
words like
""traitor""
""heretic""
""jew""
""communist""
""misogynist""

thankfully, it seems to have ground to a halt before calling someone a woman hater got you insta-banned from everywhere or executed in some gulag or concentration camp."
"2086","our society doesn't reward you for being feminine, in the same way that striving to act ""masculine"" (like being a ceo etc) does. the goal up to now has been to get women a seat at the success table, and that has meant having ""masculine"" aims. it would be good to start discussing what successful femininity looks like. i'd prefer a society that isn't driven by ""getting to the top"" type aims."
"2087","3:30 i've heard it called the ""cinderella fallacy""- that we hate disney princesses as weak because their strength comes from feminine traits like compassion, which is inherently misogynistic"
"2088","you literally just explained all of existence in one video didnt you. starting to believe you are a beautiful alien being sent to earth to help get us out of the shitty mess we are in. and youve grown so much since this video i notice. proud of you!!"
"2089","i think that bob dylan shudders every time this video plays, and he's not sure why"
"2090","if our paths cross someday, i'd love to share a drink with you. keep up the great work."
"2091","like sex, even bad feminism is better than no feminism."
"2092","ahhhh yessss contrapoints you have amazing taste, at 6:48 that was a clip of dreams by akira kurosawa!! that is my personal favorite of his"
"2093","that comment about people who did videos about justin beiber all the time 
oh i used to watch so many cringe worthy ranters who were like that
thankfully i've changed my youtube subscription palette in recent years"
"2094","do you honestly believe that continue acting ""like women"" will make men act the same? they'll keep doing what they've been doing forever if they don't feel pressure. girls, eat the world."
"2095","omg there needs to be entire albums of various parody current pop songs in the voices of classic rock stars... that is the best... i'm crying laughing and i need more..."
"2096","you seem like the type to watch american horror story"
"2097","this was an amazing video!!!!"
"2098","bob dylan t-swift killed me. love it!"
"2099","agreed that it's almost seems as if modern feminism hates the idea of feminity. i don't want feminism to be completely eradicated from the earth, but i also wanna be able to wear cute pastel and frilly things!"
"2100","adding this one to my favorites. oof that second half. <3"
"2101","could you imagine if women in their thirties complained about the music teenage boys listen to. that just sounds bizarre."
"2102","that was an amazing cover btw"
"2103","turn woman into men? so ambition is a masculine trait? why are we gendering inspirational quotes? ""never take no for an answer"" is obviously meant to be understood in an appropriate context."
"2104","that final montage was genuinely beautiful. well said."

"2108","i think we should judge by dna"

"2114","i don't think that we should be telling men to be women or women to be men. we should just stop categorizing certain emotions and behaviors as female or male. everyone has the same emotions. men and women are encouraged by society to behave in different ways and display different emotions. women can be aggressive and domineering and men can cry and be nurturing. this doesn't mean that the domineering woman is acting like a man or that the nurturing man is acting like a woman. they are acting like human beings."

"2119","wow you were early on the matt lauer thing, nice."
"2120","i don't think 90% of feminism is shit because most feminists aren't out there being asshole they're busy. i think the assholes get more attention as usual. you're average student female for instance, probably believes that rape should be taken more seriously and is probably pro choice and all that, but doesn't go out of her way to yell at people for no reason."

should have looked at the title more closely. unnngh *headdesk* ... especially since i haven't enjoyed a new game since gold & silver, why do i need to mega-evolve anything and who decided to plan the shopping city like a massive pokeball? why do you keep getting that part wrong?!?! sorry, i hate that one. whichever one it was. jesus, when are we getting an original grey brick gameboy rerelease, i want to use my old cartridges. /baked90skidramble"

"2250","this was a very exurb1a-esque video"

"2252","thank god, i'm not the only non sexist who can't stand taylor swift. i don't mind feminism being a forefront for a music career. pink and janelle monae do it fine.  something about taylor just irks the shit out of me. idk what it is. hell, i even like katy perry an rhianna though they cant sing;their hella chill.
on pop feminism, i totally agree. how have  mra been that retarded to think that feminists aren't aware that capatalism and coporations has high jacked feminism to use for marketing skemes?"

"2254","teach me your eyeliner wizardry"
"2255","did she delete her streams where she watched her old videos?"
"2256","2:49 oh okay"
"2257","god. i can't believe i watched so many of your videos and didn't realise you'd weirdly anti-feminist and complaining about women becoming ""masculine"" with no regard to the power imbalances which require direct and assertive behavior. if women stayed ""feminine"" they wouldn't be voting right now. instead just wanting men to be more ""feminine"" is ridiculous because they literally have social power over women no matter how they behave. saying that the assertiveness that feminists encourage women to have is ""rapey"" is an extreme, laughable, and painful reach."

"2261","3.50 ""what we should be doing is turning men into women."" 

i'll be honest, before i watched a video where you said you came out as trans relatively recently, well after you started this channel, i had no idea you needed to come out."
"2262","wow i just started following you, your props and lighting has come so far but you've always been great!"
"2263","except tj kirk/the amazing atheist doesn't sit there and talk about feminism 24/7. he talks about a lot of subjects and has criticized both the left and right on plenty occasions. also, who the fuck cares how old he is? comparing him to people attacking justin bieber, who is popular among young girls, implies that feminism is something primarily for young girls when it isn't.

"2271","thank you for the dylan bit.  :)"
"2272","i love how you used an image of the caligula poster when you said 95% of movies are shit xd. also, can we get a full length bob dylan cover of ""trouble when you walked in?"" that was hilarious and sounded very dylan-y. it's stuck in my head now haha"
"2273","loved the sequence with the black and white films, that was hilarious but i'm also interesting in watching them, anyone know the sources?"

"2275","ok but the part where you said longing for childhood and showed pokemon i actually cried i hate growing up"
"2276","more bob dylan impersonations!"
"2277","they say pop feminism and i say poop feminism"
"2278","i find those dove ads so insulting and patronizing."
"2279","......i dunno if i agree completely. i generally pretty much love your videos, but the idea that most feminism these days would somehow be complete trash....no. not really. i mean sure, pop feminism has absolutely flooded a lot of pop culture repackaging the idea of female and male equality into something someone can sell.  like dove who pretend to be all for that confidence in the countries where that sells while all in for the skin bleaching in the countries where that sells. 
still, i wouldn't deem all new age feminism to be bullshit shit out by twisted companies.
i think now we are making progress within intersectionality for example, and also the meetoo movement uncovering sexual harassment everywhere. and of course, i know i know , globally we have along way to go. and the constant focus on white rich womens issues is not really bringing help where it is most needed. still tho, i gotta say, to just bash third wave feminism alltogether probably just helps the wrong agenda. at least in my experience.

never become popular.

once it became popular, all the normies and power-hungry sociopaths wanted in on it.
the normies wanted an instant ""feel good about yourself"" button they could pin on their jacket, and the sociopaths love nothing more than to point at people they want to eliminate and shout words which make them go away.
words like
""traitor""
""heretic""
""jew""
""communist""
""misogynist""

"2286","our society doesn't reward you for being feminine, in the same way that striving to act ""masculine"" (like being a ceo etc) does. the goal up to now has been to get women a seat at the success table, and that has meant having ""masculine"" aims. it would be good to start discussing what successful femininity looks like. i'd prefer a society that isn't driven by ""getting to the top"" type aims."
"2287","3:30 i've heard it called the ""cinderella fallacy""- that we hate disney princesses as weak because their strength comes from feminine traits like compassion, which is inherently misogynistic"

"2314","i don't think that we should be telling men to be women or women to be men. we should just stop categorizing certain emotions and behaviors as female or male. everyone has the same emotions. men and women are encouraged by society to behave in different ways and display different emotions. women can be aggressive and domineering and men can cry and be nurturing. this doesn't mean that the domineering woman is acting like a man or that the nurturing man is acting like a woman. they are acting like human beings."

"2319","wow you were early on the matt lauer thing, nice."
"2320","i don't think 90% of feminism is shit because most feminists aren't out there being asshole they're busy. i think the assholes get more attention as usual. you're average student female for instance, probably believes that rape should be taken more seriously and is probably pro choice and all that, but doesn't go out of her way to yell at people for no reason."

"2426","i've been seriously considering getting ""imma mane"" tattooed on my knuckles"
"2427","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

"2442","as a self-identified mayonaisse i wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-sjw.

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"2459","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"2460","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk i'll happily debate this topic as long as it's performed in a civil manour."

"2466","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

"2527","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"2559","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"2560","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk i'll happily debate this topic as long as it's performed in a civil manour."

it really isn't that hard."
"2566","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

"2626","i've been seriously considering getting ""imma mane"" tattooed on my knuckles"
"2627","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

"2659","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"2660","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it.

"2666","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

"2726","i've been seriously considering getting ""imma mane"" tattooed on my knuckles"
"2727","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

"2742","as a self-identified mayonaisse i wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-sjw.

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

"2826","i've been seriously considering getting ""imma mane"" tattooed on my knuckles"
"2827","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

"2833","well, to me it's more that i don't want to care about other people's indentitiy. i don't mind if you call yourself a demiboy, but asking me, a stranger, to actively use my brain to not offend you by just using pronouns based on your biology or appearance is too much. and no, this isn't sarcasm, just as everyone has a right to free speech everyone has a right to ignore it. if you don't think you are enitrely masculine or feminine, then good, but that doesn't mean you can get offended when i don't use xer and actually expect sympathy. gender is personal, it's like masturbation, you don't have to talk about it, and nobody is obligated to care about it, you can do it as many times a day, but you shouldn't impose it on anyone else but yourself. if they are a close friend of mine, then i can start to respect your pronouns, not because i am obligated (and shouldn't be), but because i want them to be happy and if that is what it takes, then i can absolutely live with that."

"2841","i honestly don't disagree with the notion that he gender is not binary. but i think we should just do away with gender altogether instead of creating new labels. but if creating new labels is the way to get us there then i'm all for it."
"2842","as a self-identified mayonaisse i wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-sjw.

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

"2858","i feel like people just want a reason to be rude to people. they want to justify it some way or another. but no matter what, being an asshole is always uncalled for. it's never ok... 
yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"2859","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"2860","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk i'll happily debate this topic as long as it's performed in a civil manour."

i mean, come on---to take that infamous mocking example, if someone identifies as an attack helicopter, who the fuck cares? live and let live"
"2863","non binary is not a gender, it i a gender identity, you can only be born male or female, weather you like it or not."

"2926","i've been seriously considering getting ""imma mane"" tattooed on my knuckles"
"2927","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

"2933","well, to me it's more that i don't want to care about other people's indentitiy. i don't mind if you call yourself a demiboy, but asking me, a stranger, to actively use my brain to not offend you by just using pronouns based on your biology or appearance is too much. and no, this isn't sarcasm, just as everyone has a right to free speech everyone has a right to ignore it. if you don't think you are enitrely masculine or feminine, then good, but that doesn't mean you can get offended when i don't use xer and actually expect sympathy. gender is personal, it's like masturbation, you don't have to talk about it, and nobody is obligated to care about it, you can do it as many times a day, but you shouldn't impose it on anyone else but yourself. if they are a close friend of mine, then i can start to respect your pronouns, not because i am obligated (and shouldn't be), but because i want them to be happy and if that is what it takes, then i can absolutely live with that."

"2938","i'm fine with people identifying as whatever gender they want, but i don't understand how people know that they aren't a conventional gender. i'm female and i have only ever experienced how i feel, maybe part of that is my gender, what part exactly i cannot say, but i assume that some part of my feelings is my gender and, as i am female, that must be what female feels like. i can't say that it is not, because i haven't got a reference for how female should feel to compare my experience to. i am not able to predict how i would feel if i was not female, so if my gender was not female would i not still assume that it was female because i am biologically female? so how does another person who also only has there own feelings know that they feel like a non conventional gender?"

"2941","i honestly don't disagree with the notion that he gender is not binary. but i think we should just do away with gender altogether instead of creating new labels. but if creating new labels is the way to get us there then i'm all for it."
"2942","as a self-identified mayonaisse i wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-sjw.

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

"2957","cute now, cute then, cute forever."
"2958","i feel like people just want a reason to be rude to people. they want to justify it some way or another. but no matter what, being an asshole is always uncalled for. it's never ok... 
yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"2959","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"2960","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk i'll happily debate this topic as long as it's performed in a civil manour."
"2961","this video inspired me to make a video. it will take a long time. and it will be pretty bad. but it will be a video. about contrapoints. and gender.

"2962","i don't understand gender identity. i don't know what it means, and i don't actually have any clue what transgender or nonbinary people are feeling. but that's not actually relevant, you know? you got your life and i got mine, so of course i'm going to respect that. what kind of person mocks people for being different or intentionally refused to take choose your pronouns politely?

i mean, come on---to take that infamous mocking example, if someone identifies as an attack helicopter, who the fuck cares? live and let live"
"2963","non binary is not a gender, it i a gender identity, you can only be born male or female, weather you like it or not."
"2964","gender does not equal sex, if i choose to identify you as your sex you have no right to stop me. checkmate"
"2965","personally, as an nb individual, i don't like noungenders very much or it pronouns as they are a trigger for me, but if somone is enby and uses a non-they pronoun i'll just politely ask if ""they"" is okay for them. no need to be ridiculous about it. we have three perfectly good working sets of pronouns and if you disagree with or are struggling with someone going by faeself just ask to use they.
it really isn't that hard."
"2966","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

"3026","i've been seriously considering getting ""imma mane"" tattooed on my knuckles"
"3027","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

"3033","well, to me it's more that i don't want to care about other people's indentitiy. i don't mind if you call yourself a demiboy, but asking me, a stranger, to actively use my brain to not offend you by just using pronouns based on your biology or appearance is too much. and no, this isn't sarcasm, just as everyone has a right to free speech everyone has a right to ignore it. if you don't think you are enitrely masculine or feminine, then good, but that doesn't mean you can get offended when i don't use xer and actually expect sympathy. gender is personal, it's like masturbation, you don't have to talk about it, and nobody is obligated to care about it, you can do it as many times a day, but you shouldn't impose it on anyone else but yourself. if they are a close friend of mine, then i can start to respect your pronouns, not because i am obligated (and shouldn't be), but because i want them to be happy and if that is what it takes, then i can absolutely live with that."

"3042","as a self-identified mayonaisse i wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-sjw.

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

"3057","cute now, cute then, cute forever."
"3058","i feel like people just want a reason to be rude to people. they want to justify it some way or another. but no matter what, being an asshole is always uncalled for. it's never ok... 
yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"3059","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"3060","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk i'll happily debate this topic as long as it's performed in a civil manour."

"3062","i don't understand gender identity. i don't know what it means, and i don't actually have any clue what transgender or nonbinary people are feeling. but that's not actually relevant, you know? you got your life and i got mine, so of course i'm going to respect that. what kind of person mocks people for being different or intentionally refused to take choose your pronouns politely?

i mean, come on---to take that infamous mocking example, if someone identifies as an attack helicopter, who the fuck cares? live and let live"
"3063","non binary is not a gender, it i a gender identity, you can only be born male or female, weather you like it or not."
"3064","gender does not equal sex, if i choose to identify you as your sex you have no right to stop me. checkmate"
"3065","personally, as an nb individual, i don't like noungenders very much or it pronouns as they are a trigger for me, but if somone is enby and uses a non-they pronoun i'll just politely ask if ""they"" is okay for them. no need to be ridiculous about it. we have three perfectly good working sets of pronouns and if you disagree with or are struggling with someone going by faeself just ask to use they.
it really isn't that hard."
"3066","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"3159","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"3160","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it.

"3166","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

"3227","i recently discovered this channel and i'm slowly going through all of the videos. i think i am leftist enough to appreciate most of them but not enough to like all of them. 
ok, first things first. it is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. that's a given, unless you're ben shapiro. but saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. that's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males? 
of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... but ok, i'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. and i might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.
ok.
and what would that mean, exactly? what is gender, anyway? i was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. it is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, i guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change. 
so, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. but when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things. 
but this is not the true problem, either. the true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. the point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. that's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards. 
just think of it for a moment: i have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. this means that not only i can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. i feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. and not only that: i also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. and possibly fourteen pronouns, too. and none of them tells me, like, nothing about the other person. 
this won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. personally, i won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. and i really don't see the point of using it. all of the non-binary people i met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. at this point i really don't understand what they mean when they use the word ""gender"", but most importantly... whatever it means to them i don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. i mean, i see the relevance of being transgender; i see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? why would i use ""ze"" to refere to a biological male who acts ""manly"" 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? what does the ""ze"" tell about that person that ""he"" and ""she"" could not convey? that he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? we need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes? don't we have one already?"

just thought i'd mention it. . ."
"3238","i'm fine with people identifying as whatever gender they want, but i don't understand how people know that they aren't a conventional gender. i'm female and i have only ever experienced how i feel, maybe part of that is my gender, what part exactly i cannot say, but i assume that some part of my feelings is my gender and, as i am female, that must be what female feels like. i can't say that it is not, because i haven't got a reference for how female should feel to compare my experience to. i am not able to predict how i would feel if i was not female, so if my gender was not female would i not still assume that it was female because i am biologically female? so how does another person who also only has there own feelings know that they feel like a non conventional gender?"

"3242","as a self-identified mayonaisse i wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-sjw.

there are 2 genders. yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. all species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. but then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. with the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. and this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. what is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. and in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. society just dictates the norm. and society is always changing. so if anyone identifies as an apache attack helicopter, all the power to you!"

"3258","i feel like people just want a reason to be rude to people. they want to justify it some way or another. but no matter what, being an asshole is always uncalled for. it's never ok... 
yes we should all be free to think what we want and and even say what we want- but just because you can say something, doesn't mean their won't be social repercussions. you can think nonbinary genders are fake all day long, you can think it's stupid, a trend, or attention seeking, etc- but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole and disrespectful to people. at least try to use gender neutral terms when speaking about them or to them. that's all anyone really asks, and it's not that difficult. show respect, and if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. treat people how you want to be treated. period."
"3259","it's not that i care about ""proper english"", it's more about ""they"" pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. i have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. they pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but ""they"" especially when talking about multiple people. ""who's they? ohhh theeeey.""

i think respect is great, but i think there's more to the conversation than ending it at ""if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it"".

this particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone ""they"" until proven otherwise. it really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender."
"3260","hello, i am a cis, gay man. i used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? let me explain.

most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. such as genders such as ""mascgirl"" which directly defines a tomboy. 

others such as ""genderfluid"" (of which i used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. which happens to everyone anyway. everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.

do not get me wrong, i do believe there are three genders (m, f, and x) and outside of that simple spectrum i don't believe there is anything else. other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.

if you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. otherwise, no. you can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (which is entirely valid) but you are no other gender than non binary. thats it. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk i'll happily debate this topic as long as it's performed in a civil manour."
"3261","this video inspired me to make a video. it will take a long time. and it will be pretty bad. but it will be a video. about contrapoints. and gender.

"3262","i don't understand gender identity. i don't know what it means, and i don't actually have any clue what transgender or nonbinary people are feeling. but that's not actually relevant, you know? you got your life and i got mine, so of course i'm going to respect that. what kind of person mocks people for being different or intentionally refused to take choose your pronouns politely?

i mean, come on---to take that infamous mocking example, if someone identifies as an attack helicopter, who the fuck cares? live and let live"
"3263","non binary is not a gender, it i a gender identity, you can only be born male or female, weather you like it or not."
"3264","gender does not equal sex, if i choose to identify you as your sex you have no right to stop me. checkmate"
"3265","personally, as an nb individual, i don't like noungenders very much or it pronouns as they are a trigger for me, but if somone is enby and uses a non-they pronoun i'll just politely ask if ""they"" is okay for them. no need to be ridiculous about it. we have three perfectly good working sets of pronouns and if you disagree with or are struggling with someone going by faeself just ask to use they.
it really isn't that hard."
"3266","i know i am late in posting this comment ( i must be insane to even consider it ). i am biologically male and i am a practicing witch/shaman/druid depending on what goddess i worship. i am called an enaria ( womanly-man ). the third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. the third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. the great goddess agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by dionysis by zeus' command for he feared hir power. every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. the third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. in mongolia before the rise of buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres i.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. they did this when the children started puberty 10-12. in my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. it is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. the terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. i do not have gender dysphoria but i know i am not fully male i live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children i'm 23 and he is 40.......i'm a cliche i know, i know i am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm i've became both. i hope that clears it up or even add more confusion i do so enjoy it.............i worship isis/iset, hekate-erashkigal, the morrighan."

"3304","predator narcissists repackaged as mgtow 



narcissistic psychopathic males have found a new way to con unsuspecting females called mgtow by trying to scare females into believing that female freedom is causing them to mistreat females or not be interested in marriage & family any longer when in reality these guys were never ever for female rights or equality and have abused their former spouses and former girlfriends! narcissistic males are repackaging their abusive agenda as mgtow to lure women and girls and to get their sympathy or to threaten them when they don't accept their opinions as their own. beware ladies these are the wimpy bullies that women have rejected and now that they have been exposed they are rebranding themselves & have decided to use a different type of image but it's the same old nasty shit as before. these sexist narcissists are dangerous to all females if they dare trust these guys for a minute! run do not walk away from these psychopaths and ladies we all know that guys who actually love females are not falling for the bullshit & we also know that real men don't label themselves as alpha males & all other guys as betas when there is no such thing only in some species of animals but not all of them and the great males don't bully other people in general. these abusive narcissists desperately fear female independence, the right to choose & female equality because they are users and abusers who want a slave not a real female so be very aware of what this game is all about k? yea some females do mistreat guys but that is certainly not the majority and these bullies couldn't have dated all of us to make such a nasty judgement call against a whole gender & group of people who are half of the population!! be careful ladies! it's the same narcissistic abusive guys with a new package to fool those who don't suspect!

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.

"3453","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"3454","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"3455","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"3456","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"3457","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."

"3459","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

"3462","contra, you're really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"3463","love the hendrix poster."
"3464","i mean, women are attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so i don't think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. if you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. my favorite neuroscientist robert sapolsky mentions this a lot. the phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. you completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. thats preposterous."

"3470","any male who uses the words ""cuck"" ""beta"" or ""alpha"" in their vocabulary are insecure men who try to bring down others to prove their ""masculinity"". it's pretty sad actually. it's not very manly when you try to prove yourself on a comment section."

"3539","natalie i love u. i love everyone in this comment section and world. thank you for existing whoever is reading this."

"3545","you make a pretty convincing guy tbh. 🤔"
"3546","remember when we were kids and the mean boys called each other ""fag"" or ""gueerbait"" or ""homo""? they used those names against the boys they thought were ""sissies"" and ""pussies"". remember the shock of finding out more than a couple of those mean, angry boys grew up, ran away and became gay as hell? 
i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.
this alpha and beta/cuck trend is nothing new. all those alpha wannabes just want dicks in their mouths while they watch someone else fuck their beard wife."
"3547","been waiting for someone to comment on the golden one for months. such a weird, self-obsessed side of youtube"

"3553","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"3554","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"3555","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"3556","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"3557","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"3558","is this the libtard circlejerk hq, i'm in enemy territory definitely. and you thing in the video is not a male in my eyes."
"3559","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

"3604","predator narcissists repackaged as mgtow 



narcissistic psychopathic males have found a new way to con unsuspecting females called mgtow by trying to scare females into believing that female freedom is causing them to mistreat females or not be interested in marriage & family any longer when in reality these guys were never ever for female rights or equality and have abused their former spouses and former girlfriends! narcissistic males are repackaging their abusive agenda as mgtow to lure women and girls and to get their sympathy or to threaten them when they don't accept their opinions as their own. beware ladies these are the wimpy bullies that women have rejected and now that they have been exposed they are rebranding themselves & have decided to use a different type of image but it's the same old nasty shit as before. these sexist narcissists are dangerous to all females if they dare trust these guys for a minute! run do not walk away from these psychopaths and ladies we all know that guys who actually love females are not falling for the bullshit & we also know that real men don't label themselves as alpha males & all other guys as betas when there is no such thing only in some species of animals but not all of them and the great males don't bully other people in general. these abusive narcissists desperately fear female independence, the right to choose & female equality because they are users and abusers who want a slave not a real female so be very aware of what this game is all about k? yea some females do mistreat guys but that is certainly not the majority and these bullies couldn't have dated all of us to make such a nasty judgement call against a whole gender & group of people who are half of the population!! be careful ladies! it's the same narcissistic abusive guys with a new package to fool those who don't suspect!

"3619","funny thing is, a ""guy"" like you (quotes cuz i know you're not a male) would do better with women than any of those so called alphas. so, that would make this little twink the real alpha here :^)"

narcissistic psychopathic males have found a new way to con unsuspecting females called mgtow by trying to scare females into believing that female freedom is causing them to mistreat females or not be interested in marriage & family any longer when in reality these guys were never ever for female rights or equality and have abused their former spouses and former girlfriends! narcissistic males are repackaging their abusive agenda as mgtow to lure women and girls and to get their sympathy or to threaten them when they don't accept their opinions as their own. beware ladies these are the wimpy bullies that women have rejected and now that they have been exposed they are rebranding themselves & have decided to use a different type of image but it's the same old nasty shit as before. these sexist narcissists are dangerous to all females if they dare trust these guys for a minute! run do not walk away from these psychopaths and ladies we all know that guys who actually love females are not falling for the bullshit & we also know that real men don't label themselves as alpha males & all other guys as betas when there is no such thing only in some species of animals but not all of them and the great males don't bully other people in general. these abusive narcissists desperately fear female independence, the right to choose & female equality because they are users and abusers who want a slave not a real female so be very aware of what this game is all about k? yea some females do mistreat guys but that is certainly not the majority and these bullies couldn't have dated all of us to make such a nasty judgement call against a whole gender & group of people who are half of the population!! be careful ladies! it's the same narcissistic abusive guys with a new package to fool those who don't suspect!

"3719","funny thing is, a ""guy"" like you (quotes cuz i know you're not a male) would do better with women than any of those so called alphas. so, that would make this little twink the real alpha here :^)"

"3730","if it weren't for all the fascist beliefs, i'd feel sorry for this guy. it's pretty obvious that he's holding in some deep seated insecurity & a thirst for validation. when he talks about masculinity, it sounds more like he's trying to convince himself than he is us. i wonder what his father is like."
"3731","almost forgot to watch this today"
"3732","i'm trying so hard to concentrate on this video but i'm seriously distracted how the golden one's head is tiny compared to his fucking massive body :) :) :)"

 now alt-righters are using the exact same excuse- just exchanging commumism for feminism.  it' s so old. one would've hopes such a supreme group had some originality. jeez."

"3745","you make a pretty convincing guy tbh. 🤔"
"3746","remember when we were kids and the mean boys called each other ""fag"" or ""gueerbait"" or ""homo""? they used those names against the boys they thought were ""sissies"" and ""pussies"". remember the shock of finding out more than a couple of those mean, angry boys grew up, ran away and became gay as hell? 
i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.
this alpha and beta/cuck trend is nothing new. all those alpha wannabes just want dicks in their mouths while they watch someone else fuck their beard wife."
"3747","been waiting for someone to comment on the golden one for months. such a weird, self-obsessed side of youtube"
"3748","funny because where i'm looking none of these people are alphas in any sense. they aren't leaders, they're cucks omg"
"3749","weird weird weird weird weird weird"
"3750","0:20 but i thought all groups of extended germans hate the french"

"3752","i thought some of this was going to be jokes, but then he goes and actually does it... i was talking about the golden one, just to be clear."
"3753","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"3754","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"3755","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"3756","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"3757","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"3758","is this the libtard circlejerk hq, i'm in enemy territory definitely. and you thing in the video is not a male in my eyes."
"3759","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"
"3760","""milk of the fenris wolf..."" aha... ""milk""."
"3761","any guy who says he's an alpha male is a omega bitch guaranteed"
"3762","contra, you're really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"3763","love the hendrix poster."
"3764","i mean, women are attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so i don't think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. if you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. my favorite neuroscientist robert sapolsky mentions this a lot. the phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. you completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. thats preposterous."
"3765","nationalism in europe was never bad. it took nazism down after all"
"3766","if you're obsessed with alphas and betas you're an omega."
"3767","these guys sound like they dislike women because women like men and that's gay."
"3768","im new here, the guy with the makeup on is probably the prettiest man ive ever seen."
"3769","you are my hero. please keep up the good work!!!"
"3770","any male who uses the words ""cuck"" ""beta"" or ""alpha"" in their vocabulary are insecure men who try to bring down others to prove their ""masculinity"". it's pretty sad actually. it's not very manly when you try to prove yourself on a comment section."
"3771","uhh...does goldilocks know that the ""alpha"" goblin-orc-whatever totally got his head chopped off in the next scene?"

"3774","surprise flex."
"3775","8:37 when did kangaroo jack become a racist? lmaooo"
"3776","please, please don't take this the wrong way, please understand i mean this in a positive, complimentary way... but seeing you as you are in the beginning of this video makes me sincerely wish you would reconsider and opt against physically transitioning. you are so perfect just the way you are, and it's so rare to find someone who i can relate to, as most people like me are always focused on transitioning instead of finding contentment with the bodies they were born with. and let me be clear, i do understand that for some people it is very difficult or even almost impossible to find contentment with the bodies they were born with. but i always try to urge anyone like me to really think about whether she is transitioning solely for personal benefit and betterment, or whether it is more a decision based on social pressures, specifically the social pressure that erroneously insists that you're not allowed to be accepted as who you are if you don't physically possess a vagina.
either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."
"3777","this guy would make a good trans girl."
"3778","as much as i hate to say it, and i do, i kind of like that guy too against my better judgment. he's kinda goofy, i like watching people run around in costumes, and we both like skyrim. kind of bummed he's a misogynist nazi asshole."
"3779","there can't be any alphas in a sexually repressed culture - any kind of repressed culture, but that one takes the proverbial cake"

omfg he turned it into kinda a bop at the end there"
"3781","according to the amount self-proclaimed alphas on the internet, they outnumber betas 100 to 1. real alphas don't express it and are leaders, and they look after the weaker among them. they also don't go after betas, they go after other alphas."
"3782","these guys are fucking losers. to bad they don't all die."
"3783","it is pretty simple why they are all racist. they simply favor a hierarchical society because they believe it will aid them and therefore you attack equality and democracy on every level."
"3784","as a brown female, i noticed the soap scum on that bathtub immediately, and i insist you get some white vinegar on that ring."
"3785","great research! i did not notice these connections before between the alpha male bs and the other stuff."

"3791","you are beautiful and gorgeous and amazing!"
"3792","quick comment:can we start no longer switching nationalism and national socialism as if they are the same. nationalism has no inherent bad virtues, and has been used several times in a liberal progressive way. currently everyone knows that nazism and facism is horrible, our fear and disgust of of it however has created a lot of misunderstandings on anything right of center"

"3802","i know this video is super old you have like a 0% chance of seeing this but what the hell. i am curious what your thoughts are on more mens fashion/lifestyle people like alpha m and so on. it seems like they use a decent amount of the same ideas around dating/women that you brought up here. and they definitely fulfill the parts about trying to sell you something. i feel like they definitely feed on the idea of being ""alpha"" and getting women and a lot of fragility behind being ""manly""."

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.

"3953","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"3954","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"3955","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"3956","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"3957","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"3958","is this the libtard circlejerk hq, i'm in enemy territory definitely. and you thing in the video is not a male in my eyes."
"3959","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil.

"4028","i love you. lol this hit home with me so hard. as a gay male i've been called beta so many times ironically by men who want to sleep with me and think that labeling me as some sort of submissive sex object will make me take my pants right off!"
"4029","that's a photo from nosferatu the vampyre!!!"
"4030","if it weren't for all the fascist beliefs, i'd feel sorry for this guy. it's pretty obvious that he's holding in some deep seated insecurity & a thirst for validation. when he talks about masculinity, it sounds more like he's trying to convince himself than he is us. i wonder what his father is like."
"4031","almost forgot to watch this today"
"4032","i'm trying so hard to concentrate on this video but i'm seriously distracted how the golden one's head is tiny compared to his fucking massive body :) :) :)"
"4033","what about the left wing alpha males, aka the ""white knights"" who bully guys who get rejected, and always take the woman's side even when the woman is being a hypocrite?"
"4034","the jews fund contrapoints, unsubbed.
jk. hitler told the german citizens that joos (""the international jew"") were behind commmunism, bolshevism,and marxism (while in reality- yes, individual jews were behind it aka marx, lenin, many bolsheviks-- but not ""the jews"", wtf). he used toxic idea in order to derail the masses against them, shifting the blame for the german poverty and failure of the early 20th century from the epic failure the german goverment did in ww1 to an amorphous ""jews!!"".

 now alt-righters are using the exact same excuse- just exchanging commumism for feminism.  it' s so old. one would've hopes such a supreme group had some originality. jeez."
"4035","i still ship golden one x contrapoints"
"4036","nah i would still rather be like the golden one"
"4037","alpha means confident and masculine, you silly goose. of course we cannot all be presidents and billionaires. and you don't have to, happiness is much easier to achieve."
"4038","i've fallen in love with this video! you are fucking awesome! *hugs* subscribing!"
"4039","natalie i love u. i love everyone in this comment section and world. thank you for existing whoever is reading this."
"4040","is it weird that i wanna have smex with you"
"4041","brilliant!"
"4042","is being pro israel racist?"
"4043","the golden one is like a backwards devolved tossed-in-toxic-waste unattractive thor
i agree tho, if he weren't an ""alpha"" nazi, he'd be really fun to follow"
"4044","hillarious! :d i always new that he-man exists."
"4045","you make a pretty convincing guy tbh. 🤔"
"4046","remember when we were kids and the mean boys called each other ""fag"" or ""gueerbait"" or ""homo""? they used those names against the boys they thought were ""sissies"" and ""pussies"". remember the shock of finding out more than a couple of those mean, angry boys grew up, ran away and became gay as hell? 
i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.
this alpha and beta/cuck trend is nothing new. all those alpha wannabes just want dicks in their mouths while they watch someone else fuck their beard wife."
"4047","been waiting for someone to comment on the golden one for months. such a weird, self-obsessed side of youtube"
"4048","funny because where i'm looking none of these people are alphas in any sense. they aren't leaders, they're cucks omg"
"4049","weird weird weird weird weird weird"
"4050","0:20 but i thought all groups of extended germans hate the french"
"4051","2:14 that golden speedo blended so well with your skin tone that i got shocked for a second because i thought you were naked"
"4052","i thought some of this was going to be jokes, but then he goes and actually does it... i was talking about the golden one, just to be clear."
"4053","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"4054","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"4055","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"4056","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"4057","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"4058","is this the libtard circlejerk hq, i'm in enemy territory definitely. and you thing in the video is not a male in my eyes."
"4059","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

"4062","contra, you're really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"4063","love the hendrix poster."
"4064","i mean, women are attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so i don't think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. if you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. my favorite neuroscientist robert sapolsky mentions this a lot. the phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. you completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. thats preposterous."
"4065","nationalism in europe was never bad. it took nazism down after all"
"4066","if you're obsessed with alphas and betas you're an omega."
"4067","these guys sound like they dislike women because women like men and that's gay."
"4068","im new here, the guy with the makeup on is probably the prettiest man ive ever seen."
"4069","you are my hero. please keep up the good work!!!"
"4070","any male who uses the words ""cuck"" ""beta"" or ""alpha"" in their vocabulary are insecure men who try to bring down others to prove their ""masculinity"". it's pretty sad actually. it's not very manly when you try to prove yourself on a comment section."

"4076","please, please don't take this the wrong way, please understand i mean this in a positive, complimentary way... but seeing you as you are in the beginning of this video makes me sincerely wish you would reconsider and opt against physically transitioning. you are so perfect just the way you are, and it's so rare to find someone who i can relate to, as most people like me are always focused on transitioning instead of finding contentment with the bodies they were born with. and let me be clear, i do understand that for some people it is very difficult or even almost impossible to find contentment with the bodies they were born with. but i always try to urge anyone like me to really think about whether she is transitioning solely for personal benefit and betterment, or whether it is more a decision based on social pressures, specifically the social pressure that erroneously insists that you're not allowed to be accepted as who you are if you don't physically possess a vagina.
either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."
"4077","this guy would make a good trans girl."
"4078","as much as i hate to say it, and i do, i kind of like that guy too against my better judgment. he's kinda goofy, i like watching people run around in costumes, and we both like skyrim. kind of bummed he's a misogynist nazi asshole."

"4082","these guys are fucking losers. to bad they don't all die."
"4083","it is pretty simple why they are all racist. they simply favor a hierarchical society because they believe it will aid them and therefore you attack equality and democracy on every level."

"4102","i know this video is super old you have like a 0% chance of seeing this but what the hell. i am curious what your thoughts are on more mens fashion/lifestyle people like alpha m and so on. it seems like they use a decent amount of the same ideas around dating/women that you brought up here. and they definitely fulfill the parts about trying to sell you something. i feel like they definitely feed on the idea of being ""alpha"" and getting women and a lot of fragility behind being ""manly""."
"4103","natalie: great videos man. got turned on to you last night through a buddy of mine, and i've been on a 9 hour binge. utterly brilliant stuff mate; even with the little jabs and subtle nuances you insert for context... fantastic stuff... re: this particular video, could we not agree to be ""beta +""?"
"4104","predator narcissists repackaged as mgtow 



narcissistic psychopathic males have found a new way to con unsuspecting females called mgtow by trying to scare females into believing that female freedom is causing them to mistreat females or not be interested in marriage & family any longer when in reality these guys were never ever for female rights or equality and have abused their former spouses and former girlfriends! narcissistic males are repackaging their abusive agenda as mgtow to lure women and girls and to get their sympathy or to threaten them when they don't accept their opinions as their own. beware ladies these are the wimpy bullies that women have rejected and now that they have been exposed they are rebranding themselves & have decided to use a different type of image but it's the same old nasty shit as before. these sexist narcissists are dangerous to all females if they dare trust these guys for a minute! run do not walk away from these psychopaths and ladies we all know that guys who actually love females are not falling for the bullshit & we also know that real men don't label themselves as alpha males & all other guys as betas when there is no such thing only in some species of animals but not all of them and the great males don't bully other people in general. these abusive narcissists desperately fear female independence, the right to choose & female equality because they are users and abusers who want a slave not a real female so be very aware of what this game is all about k? yea some females do mistreat guys but that is certainly not the majority and these bullies couldn't have dated all of us to make such a nasty judgement call against a whole gender & group of people who are half of the population!! be careful ladies! it's the same narcissistic abusive guys with a new package to fool those who don't suspect!

"4204","predator narcissists repackaged as mgtow 



narcissistic psychopathic males have found a new way to con unsuspecting females called mgtow by trying to scare females into believing that female freedom is causing them to mistreat females or not be interested in marriage & family any longer when in reality these guys were never ever for female rights or equality and have abused their former spouses and former girlfriends! narcissistic males are repackaging their abusive agenda as mgtow to lure women and girls and to get their sympathy or to threaten them when they don't accept their opinions as their own. beware ladies these are the wimpy bullies that women have rejected and now that they have been exposed they are rebranding themselves & have decided to use a different type of image but it's the same old nasty shit as before. these sexist narcissists are dangerous to all females if they dare trust these guys for a minute! run do not walk away from these psychopaths and ladies we all know that guys who actually love females are not falling for the bullshit & we also know that real men don't label themselves as alpha males & all other guys as betas when there is no such thing only in some species of animals but not all of them and the great males don't bully other people in general. these abusive narcissists desperately fear female independence, the right to choose & female equality because they are users and abusers who want a slave not a real female so be very aware of what this game is all about k? yea some females do mistreat guys but that is certainly not the majority and these bullies couldn't have dated all of us to make such a nasty judgement call against a whole gender & group of people who are half of the population!! be careful ladies! it's the same narcissistic abusive guys with a new package to fool those who don't suspect!

i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.

"4254","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"4255","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

"4262","contra, you're really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"4263","love the hendrix poster."
"4264","i mean, women are attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so i don't think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. if you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. my favorite neuroscientist robert sapolsky mentions this a lot. the phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. you completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. thats preposterous."

"4276","please, please don't take this the wrong way, please understand i mean this in a positive, complimentary way... but seeing you as you are in the beginning of this video makes me sincerely wish you would reconsider and opt against physically transitioning. you are so perfect just the way you are, and it's so rare to find someone who i can relate to, as most people like me are always focused on transitioning instead of finding contentment with the bodies they were born with. and let me be clear, i do understand that for some people it is very difficult or even almost impossible to find contentment with the bodies they were born with. but i always try to urge anyone like me to really think about whether she is transitioning solely for personal benefit and betterment, or whether it is more a decision based on social pressures, specifically the social pressure that erroneously insists that you're not allowed to be accepted as who you are if you don't physically possess a vagina.
either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.

"4555","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil.

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

"4604","predator narcissists repackaged as mgtow 



narcissistic psychopathic males have found a new way to con unsuspecting females called mgtow by trying to scare females into believing that female freedom is causing them to mistreat females or not be interested in marriage & family any longer when in reality these guys were never ever for female rights or equality and have abused their former spouses and former girlfriends! narcissistic males are repackaging their abusive agenda as mgtow to lure women and girls and to get their sympathy or to threaten them when they don't accept their opinions as their own. beware ladies these are the wimpy bullies that women have rejected and now that they have been exposed they are rebranding themselves & have decided to use a different type of image but it's the same old nasty shit as before. these sexist narcissists are dangerous to all females if they dare trust these guys for a minute! run do not walk away from these psychopaths and ladies we all know that guys who actually love females are not falling for the bullshit & we also know that real men don't label themselves as alpha males & all other guys as betas when there is no such thing only in some species of animals but not all of them and the great males don't bully other people in general. these abusive narcissists desperately fear female independence, the right to choose & female equality because they are users and abusers who want a slave not a real female so be very aware of what this game is all about k? yea some females do mistreat guys but that is certainly not the majority and these bullies couldn't have dated all of us to make such a nasty judgement call against a whole gender & group of people who are half of the population!! be careful ladies! it's the same narcissistic abusive guys with a new package to fool those who don't suspect!

i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.

"4754","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"4755","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

"4762","contra, you're really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"4763","love the hendrix poster."
"4764","i mean, women are attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so i don't think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. if you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. my favorite neuroscientist robert sapolsky mentions this a lot. the phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. you completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. thats preposterous."

"4770","any male who uses the words ""cuck"" ""beta"" or ""alpha"" in their vocabulary are insecure men who try to bring down others to prove their ""masculinity"". it's pretty sad actually. it's not very manly when you try to prove yourself on a comment section."

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

"4853","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"4854","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"4855","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"4856","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"4857","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"4858","is this the libtard circlejerk hq, i'm in enemy territory definitely. and you thing in the video is not a male in my eyes."
"4859","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

"5018","i know it's an old video but as a person who is concerned with games and works for a games company i still find it fun that they think that alpha is superior to beta...cause i keep thinking of alpha as the broken proof of concept phase and beta as a less broken you are finally ready to show it to the world phase..."
"5019","funny thing is, a ""guy"" like you (quotes cuz i know you're not a male) would do better with women than any of those so called alphas. so, that would make this little twink the real alpha here :^)"

"5030","if it weren't for all the fascist beliefs, i'd feel sorry for this guy. it's pretty obvious that he's holding in some deep seated insecurity & a thirst for validation. when he talks about masculinity, it sounds more like he's trying to convince himself than he is us. i wonder what his father is like."

 now alt-righters are using the exact same excuse- just exchanging commumism for feminism.  it' s so old. one would've hopes such a supreme group had some originality. jeez."

i met guys like that in the army. one of them was so abusive about it i had to laugh my ass off when i found him on facebook living out with his husband.
this alpha and beta/cuck trend is nothing new. all those alpha wannabes just want dicks in their mouths while they watch someone else fuck their beard wife."
"5047","been waiting for someone to comment on the golden one for months. such a weird, self-obsessed side of youtube"

"5053","tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"5054","i noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. if they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"5055","i hope the golden one will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...teddy watching from one of his ikea loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of the golden twink. 😘"
"5056","in contrast to these ""alpha males"", i think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"5057","i can't help be feel like uh, red pill philosophy's comment about sex being ""impaling"" women with an ""ugly engorged penis"" is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. i've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking i want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"5058","is this the libtard circlejerk hq, i'm in enemy territory definitely. and you thing in the video is not a male in my eyes."
"5059","there is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.

nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil. 

i wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

"5062","contra, you're really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"5063","love the hendrix poster."
"5064","i mean, women are attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so i don't think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. if you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. my favorite neuroscientist robert sapolsky mentions this a lot. the phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. you completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. thats preposterous."

"5070","any male who uses the words ""cuck"" ""beta"" or ""alpha"" in their vocabulary are insecure men who try to bring down others to prove their ""masculinity"". it's pretty sad actually. it's not very manly when you try to prove yourself on a comment section."

"5076","please, please don't take this the wrong way, please understand i mean this in a positive, complimentary way... but seeing you as you are in the beginning of this video makes me sincerely wish you would reconsider and opt against physically transitioning. you are so perfect just the way you are, and it's so rare to find someone who i can relate to, as most people like me are always focused on transitioning instead of finding contentment with the bodies they were born with. and let me be clear, i do understand that for some people it is very difficult or even almost impossible to find contentment with the bodies they were born with. but i always try to urge anyone like me to really think about whether she is transitioning solely for personal benefit and betterment, or whether it is more a decision based on social pressures, specifically the social pressure that erroneously insists that you're not allowed to be accepted as who you are if you don't physically possess a vagina.
either way just know that i think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but i also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! if you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. also know that, when i see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. i would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if i presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but i constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."

"5082","these guys are fucking losers. to bad they don't all die."

"5103","it's probably a bit transphobic to think like this, but the 'being a man' comments like 'i'm a bit of a man slut myself' were funny"

"5105","it's been amazing how much you've changed in your transition since videos from this time. you look, sound and even gesture way more femininely nowadays."
"5106","unlike these pick up artists i always thought it was important to be good at sex. not only is that just good manners but at least that way when the prospective partner rejects me i know it really *is* her loss, not just mine. 

(also surely quality at sex rather than quantity of sex partners is the real way to be an alpha male.)"
"5107","boys are gross."

"5115","thank you so much for the video! finally an honest take on pua"
"5116","ispagna lasagna"
"5117","i've always wondered why pick up artists even exists. i mean it is the fault of toxic masculinity also that men think sex is commodity and you have to have as much as possible to be 'cool' right? it just proves you're a very insecure person obsessed with proving to -god knows who- that you're 'worthy'. maybe to your toxic, insecure bro friends. but idk what do i know."
"5118","props to the clockwork orange reference, and you're absolutely right about oral sex. i rejected my husband when we first started dating, but his cunnilingus alone got me back. i'm not fucking kidding. he's really, really good at it. and that matters. men, take note. you need to be able to to go down on a woman if you want to impress her in bed.

of course, later, the reason our relationship worked was for a shitload of reasons that i can't summarize here. but it started with getting head, and that's the truth."

"5148","i also think that men often don't understand that a women isnt just a passive subject that is there to be seduced. they decide if they want to have sex or not. you having sex is just a result of her making that decision of 'im going to have sex tonight' earlier in the day. i don't think men understand that 'seduction' often just isn't a thing. the girl looks at you, decides if you're hot enough for the evening, talks to you to see if you're a murderer or not, then decides to go home with you. the seduction part is just 'how to act normal enough to her so she doesn't think i'm a raping pickup artist.'"
"5149","6:15
don't blink!"
"5150","you know, i want role models too. but holy shit, when i see dudes looking at someone like roosh as someone to look up to... man that makes me sad."
"5151","the way those ""alpha males"" talk about sex makes me think that they might be gay or asexual, but they're in denial. men being attracted to other men, or not being interested in sex at all isn't considered ""masculine."" so rather than considering that they don't like sex or aren't attracted to women, they conclude that sex isn't supposed to be enjoyable for men. it's just a disgusting and tedious way to make babies and feel powerful."

"5172","i think there's confusion out there regarding the distinction between pick-up and the larger manosphere. they are obviously intertwined and every normal man wants to get better with women so there's overlap but i would argue that 'pure' pick-up is dead in the 2010's. all the top guys are speaking very holistically and their message is that of positivity and putting a fire in your belly in all areas of life, which are interconnected; it can be compared to substance abuse treatment, criminal rehabilitation or other social work where the focus is on strengthening all areas of life to lead a happier, more productive existence. even the primitive game advice in the 90's, 00' or even prior to the 90's was not about doing some underhanded magician trick that would somehow get a woman to fall in love with you (lol) but owning your sexuality and understanding how intergender social interaction works so that both parties can have a nice experience; let's face it; a woman is not going to go to bed with a man unless he has already evoked positive feelings in her; it's about mutual pleasure. if you're socially awkward, even on the autism spectrum, you may try, try and try and never get a positive experience for either party but when you own your sexuality, commit to self-improvement and understanding female psychology you can have a positive experience even if you get shot down because you now have the balls to go up to a woman and demonstrate interest, which makes her feel good on some level even if she cannot exactly reciprocate completely at the time. as for the exploitation of women thing; it's not real. every guy that commits to game is growing in value and even cool guys with their life together and good social skills (and good heart) get shot down the vast majority of the time; sometimes rudely. women will continue to play dumb and hoard attention from both beta orbiters and the game aware guys whose value is on the rise and the game aware guys will provide the women with validation and good experiences for nothing in return most of the time without making it awkward for the girls because these guys have internalized the abundance mentality and their ego does not rise and fall according to the response of the girl no matter how vitriolic it is so they don't become stalkers or violent. the game aware guys are making the world a better place for everyone through their positive attitude and go-getter mentality. he may not be the best looking guy but if you have a good looking socially unaware blue pill guy and an average looking positive minded game guy in a club what's going to happen? well the woman (looking for male attention, sex and possibly a relationship) will eye the blue pill guy but if they get into a conversation (which is unlikely because the blue pill guy pedestalizes women and is ashamed of his gender) the blue pill guy will make a bunch of subtle social mistakes (nothing heinous, it's just that he cannot lead the interaction and make her lose her socially conditioned inhibitions) that will turn the girl off or gets stuck in the comfort building phase or whatever phase he's uncomfortable with and both the girl and the guy go home frustrated that night."

"5174","you're so fucking weird and i love it so much."
"5175","okay, so i'm far from some incubus-esque virtuoso of hanky panky (i've only had like three sexual partners in my 28 years of never-ending existential horror that is life), but i've honestly never understood what's so difficult about unclasping a bra... you just, you know, kinda pinch it and it comes off. even my past girlfriends have seemed taken aback by it, as if i'm working some hellish black sorcery. is it really that difficult for most people? i swear to my lord and master mephistopheles i'm not trying to humble-brag or anything, i really don't give a shit about sexual prowess, i've just always been kind of confused by it always being something that's brought up."

we don't hate you for being awkward. we hate you because you glorify mass shooters and rapists.
women don't want to be with you, in part due to your ugliness, but also that you act and think like creepy rapists, who care only for themselves. no one wants to hang around a person who thinks women should be given to men by the state.

"5194","the pick up artist mentality almost strikes me as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder. it's no about enjoyment or even about gaining the respect of other males, it's just about repeating a certain act as many times as possible."

"5197","you know...

"5201","omfg her old videos are so odd to see. what a glow up lmao"
"5202","so what you're telling me is: this guy obsesses over what other guys think of him while having pleasureless sex with random women? and people buy his books to learn how to do this?"
"5203","it's probably a bit transphobic to think like this, but the 'being a man' comments like 'i'm a bit of a man slut myself' were funny"
"5204","""before i penetrate this topic too deeply, i want to pull out to cock block some premature objections."" 😂😂😂"
"5205","it's been amazing how much you've changed in your transition since videos from this time. you look, sound and even gesture way more femininely nowadays."
"5206","unlike these pick up artists i always thought it was important to be good at sex. not only is that just good manners but at least that way when the prospective partner rejects me i know it really *is* her loss, not just mine. 

(also surely quality at sex rather than quantity of sex partners is the real way to be an alpha male.)"
"5207","boys are gross."
"5208","i'm so glad i never fell prey to a pick up artist. but i feel bad  women were tricked by these guys. that sucks."

"5216","ispagna lasagna"
"5217","i've always wondered why pick up artists even exists. i mean it is the fault of toxic masculinity also that men think sex is commodity and you have to have as much as possible to be 'cool' right? it just proves you're a very insecure person obsessed with proving to -god knows who- that you're 'worthy'. maybe to your toxic, insecure bro friends. but idk what do i know."
"5218","props to the clockwork orange reference, and you're absolutely right about oral sex. i rejected my husband when we first started dating, but his cunnilingus alone got me back. i'm not fucking kidding. he's really, really good at it. and that matters. men, take note. you need to be able to to go down on a woman if you want to impress her in bed.

of course, later, the reason our relationship worked was for a shitload of reasons that i can't summarize here. but it started with getting head, and that's the truth."

"5248","i also think that men often don't understand that a women isnt just a passive subject that is there to be seduced. they decide if they want to have sex or not. you having sex is just a result of her making that decision of 'im going to have sex tonight' earlier in the day. i don't think men understand that 'seduction' often just isn't a thing. the girl looks at you, decides if you're hot enough for the evening, talks to you to see if you're a murderer or not, then decides to go home with you. the seduction part is just 'how to act normal enough to her so she doesn't think i'm a raping pickup artist.'"
"5249","6:15
don't blink!"
"5250","you know, i want role models too. but holy shit, when i see dudes looking at someone like roosh as someone to look up to... man that makes me sad."
"5251","the way those ""alpha males"" talk about sex makes me think that they might be gay or asexual, but they're in denial. men being attracted to other men, or not being interested in sex at all isn't considered ""masculine."" so rather than considering that they don't like sex or aren't attracted to women, they conclude that sex isn't supposed to be enjoyable for men. it's just a disgusting and tedious way to make babies and feel powerful."

"5272","i think there's confusion out there regarding the distinction between pick-up and the larger manosphere. they are obviously intertwined and every normal man wants to get better with women so there's overlap but i would argue that 'pure' pick-up is dead in the 2010's. all the top guys are speaking very holistically and their message is that of positivity and putting a fire in your belly in all areas of life, which are interconnected; it can be compared to substance abuse treatment, criminal rehabilitation or other social work where the focus is on strengthening all areas of life to lead a happier, more productive existence. even the primitive game advice in the 90's, 00' or even prior to the 90's was not about doing some underhanded magician trick that would somehow get a woman to fall in love with you (lol) but owning your sexuality and understanding how intergender social interaction works so that both parties can have a nice experience; let's face it; a woman is not going to go to bed with a man unless he has already evoked positive feelings in her; it's about mutual pleasure. if you're socially awkward, even on the autism spectrum, you may try, try and try and never get a positive experience for either party but when you own your sexuality, commit to self-improvement and understanding female psychology you can have a positive experience even if you get shot down because you now have the balls to go up to a woman and demonstrate interest, which makes her feel good on some level even if she cannot exactly reciprocate completely at the time. as for the exploitation of women thing; it's not real. every guy that commits to game is growing in value and even cool guys with their life together and good social skills (and good heart) get shot down the vast majority of the time; sometimes rudely. women will continue to play dumb and hoard attention from both beta orbiters and the game aware guys whose value is on the rise and the game aware guys will provide the women with validation and good experiences for nothing in return most of the time without making it awkward for the girls because these guys have internalized the abundance mentality and their ego does not rise and fall according to the response of the girl no matter how vitriolic it is so they don't become stalkers or violent. the game aware guys are making the world a better place for everyone through their positive attitude and go-getter mentality. he may not be the best looking guy but if you have a good looking socially unaware blue pill guy and an average looking positive minded game guy in a club what's going to happen? well the woman (looking for male attention, sex and possibly a relationship) will eye the blue pill guy but if they get into a conversation (which is unlikely because the blue pill guy pedestalizes women and is ashamed of his gender) the blue pill guy will make a bunch of subtle social mistakes (nothing heinous, it's just that he cannot lead the interaction and make her lose her socially conditioned inhibitions) that will turn the girl off or gets stuck in the comfort building phase or whatever phase he's uncomfortable with and both the girl and the guy go home frustrated that night."

"5274","you're so fucking weird and i love it so much."
"5275","okay, so i'm far from some incubus-esque virtuoso of hanky panky (i've only had like three sexual partners in my 28 years of never-ending existential horror that is life), but i've honestly never understood what's so difficult about unclasping a bra... you just, you know, kinda pinch it and it comes off. even my past girlfriends have seemed taken aback by it, as if i'm working some hellish black sorcery. is it really that difficult for most people? i swear to my lord and master mephistopheles i'm not trying to humble-brag or anything, i really don't give a shit about sexual prowess, i've just always been kind of confused by it always being something that's brought up."

women don't want to be with you, in part due to your ugliness, but also that you act and think like creepy rapists, who care only for themselves. no one wants to hang around a person who thinks women should be given to men by the state.

"5394","the pick up artist mentality almost strikes me as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder. it's no about enjoyment or even about gaining the respect of other males, it's just about repeating a certain act as many times as possible."
"5395","wut?"

"5397","you know...

"5401","omfg her old videos are so odd to see. what a glow up lmao"
"5402","so what you're telling me is: this guy obsesses over what other guys think of him while having pleasureless sex with random women? and people buy his books to learn how to do this?"
"5403","it's probably a bit transphobic to think like this, but the 'being a man' comments like 'i'm a bit of a man slut myself' were funny"
"5404","""before i penetrate this topic too deeply, i want to pull out to cock block some premature objections."" 😂😂😂"
"5405","it's been amazing how much you've changed in your transition since videos from this time. you look, sound and even gesture way more femininely nowadays."
"5406","unlike these pick up artists i always thought it was important to be good at sex. not only is that just good manners but at least that way when the prospective partner rejects me i know it really *is* her loss, not just mine. 

(also surely quality at sex rather than quantity of sex partners is the real way to be an alpha male.)"
"5407","boys are gross."
"5408","i'm so glad i never fell prey to a pick up artist. but i feel bad  women were tricked by these guys. that sucks."

"5416","ispagna lasagna"
"5417","i've always wondered why pick up artists even exists. i mean it is the fault of toxic masculinity also that men think sex is commodity and you have to have as much as possible to be 'cool' right? it just proves you're a very insecure person obsessed with proving to -god knows who- that you're 'worthy'. maybe to your toxic, insecure bro friends. but idk what do i know."
"5418","props to the clockwork orange reference, and you're absolutely right about oral sex. i rejected my husband when we first started dating, but his cunnilingus alone got me back. i'm not fucking kidding. he's really, really good at it. and that matters. men, take note. you need to be able to to go down on a woman if you want to impress her in bed.

of course, later, the reason our relationship worked was for a shitload of reasons that i can't summarize here. but it started with getting head, and that's the truth."

"5426","calling beneath the video/comment section a dooblydoo is a vlog brothers reference that would've spread through the community like tyler oakley's 'hey whatsup you guys'

"5447","3:14 ""lessen the resistance"". jesus!"
"5448","i also think that men often don't understand that a women isnt just a passive subject that is there to be seduced. they decide if they want to have sex or not. you having sex is just a result of her making that decision of 'im going to have sex tonight' earlier in the day. i don't think men understand that 'seduction' often just isn't a thing. the girl looks at you, decides if you're hot enough for the evening, talks to you to see if you're a murderer or not, then decides to go home with you. the seduction part is just 'how to act normal enough to her so she doesn't think i'm a raping pickup artist.'"
"5449","6:15
don't blink!"
"5450","you know, i want role models too. but holy shit, when i see dudes looking at someone like roosh as someone to look up to... man that makes me sad."
"5451","the way those ""alpha males"" talk about sex makes me think that they might be gay or asexual, but they're in denial. men being attracted to other men, or not being interested in sex at all isn't considered ""masculine."" so rather than considering that they don't like sex or aren't attracted to women, they conclude that sex isn't supposed to be enjoyable for men. it's just a disgusting and tedious way to make babies and feel powerful."

"5472","i think there's confusion out there regarding the distinction between pick-up and the larger manosphere. they are obviously intertwined and every normal man wants to get better with women so there's overlap but i would argue that 'pure' pick-up is dead in the 2010's. all the top guys are speaking very holistically and their message is that of positivity and putting a fire in your belly in all areas of life, which are interconnected; it can be compared to substance abuse treatment, criminal rehabilitation or other social work where the focus is on strengthening all areas of life to lead a happier, more productive existence. even the primitive game advice in the 90's, 00' or even prior to the 90's was not about doing some underhanded magician trick that would somehow get a woman to fall in love with you (lol) but owning your sexuality and understanding how intergender social interaction works so that both parties can have a nice experience; let's face it; a woman is not going to go to bed with a man unless he has already evoked positive feelings in her; it's about mutual pleasure. if you're socially awkward, even on the autism spectrum, you may try, try and try and never get a positive experience for either party but when you own your sexuality, commit to self-improvement and understanding female psychology you can have a positive experience even if you get shot down because you now have the balls to go up to a woman and demonstrate interest, which makes her feel good on some level even if she cannot exactly reciprocate completely at the time. as for the exploitation of women thing; it's not real. every guy that commits to game is growing in value and even cool guys with their life together and good social skills (and good heart) get shot down the vast majority of the time; sometimes rudely. women will continue to play dumb and hoard attention from both beta orbiters and the game aware guys whose value is on the rise and the game aware guys will provide the women with validation and good experiences for nothing in return most of the time without making it awkward for the girls because these guys have internalized the abundance mentality and their ego does not rise and fall according to the response of the girl no matter how vitriolic it is so they don't become stalkers or violent. the game aware guys are making the world a better place for everyone through their positive attitude and go-getter mentality. he may not be the best looking guy but if you have a good looking socially unaware blue pill guy and an average looking positive minded game guy in a club what's going to happen? well the woman (looking for male attention, sex and possibly a relationship) will eye the blue pill guy but if they get into a conversation (which is unlikely because the blue pill guy pedestalizes women and is ashamed of his gender) the blue pill guy will make a bunch of subtle social mistakes (nothing heinous, it's just that he cannot lead the interaction and make her lose her socially conditioned inhibitions) that will turn the girl off or gets stuck in the comfort building phase or whatever phase he's uncomfortable with and both the girl and the guy go home frustrated that night."
"5473","nooooo you're murdering those oysters what about the liquor nooooo"
"5474","you're so fucking weird and i love it so much."
"5475","okay, so i'm far from some incubus-esque virtuoso of hanky panky (i've only had like three sexual partners in my 28 years of never-ending existential horror that is life), but i've honestly never understood what's so difficult about unclasping a bra... you just, you know, kinda pinch it and it comes off. even my past girlfriends have seemed taken aback by it, as if i'm working some hellish black sorcery. is it really that difficult for most people? i swear to my lord and master mephistopheles i'm not trying to humble-brag or anything, i really don't give a shit about sexual prowess, i've just always been kind of confused by it always being something that's brought up."

women don't want to be with you, in part due to your ugliness, but also that you act and think like creepy rapists, who care only for themselves. no one wants to hang around a person who thinks women should be given to men by the state.

"5594","the pick up artist mentality almost strikes me as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder. it's no about enjoyment or even about gaining the respect of other males, it's just about repeating a certain act as many times as possible."
"5595","wut?"

"5597","you know...

"5601","omfg her old videos are so odd to see. what a glow up lmao"
"5602","so what you're telling me is: this guy obsesses over what other guys think of him while having pleasureless sex with random women? and people buy his books to learn how to do this?"
"5603","it's probably a bit transphobic to think like this, but the 'being a man' comments like 'i'm a bit of a man slut myself' were funny"
"5604","""before i penetrate this topic too deeply, i want to pull out to cock block some premature objections."" 😂😂😂"
"5605","it's been amazing how much you've changed in your transition since videos from this time. you look, sound and even gesture way more femininely nowadays."
"5606","unlike these pick up artists i always thought it was important to be good at sex. not only is that just good manners but at least that way when the prospective partner rejects me i know it really *is* her loss, not just mine. 

(also surely quality at sex rather than quantity of sex partners is the real way to be an alpha male.)"
"5607","boys are gross."
"5608","i'm so glad i never fell prey to a pick up artist. but i feel bad  women were tricked by these guys. that sucks."

"5616","ispagna lasagna"
"5617","i've always wondered why pick up artists even exists. i mean it is the fault of toxic masculinity also that men think sex is commodity and you have to have as much as possible to be 'cool' right? it just proves you're a very insecure person obsessed with proving to -god knows who- that you're 'worthy'. maybe to your toxic, insecure bro friends. but idk what do i know."
"5618","props to the clockwork orange reference, and you're absolutely right about oral sex. i rejected my husband when we first started dating, but his cunnilingus alone got me back. i'm not fucking kidding. he's really, really good at it. and that matters. men, take note. you need to be able to to go down on a woman if you want to impress her in bed.

of course, later, the reason our relationship worked was for a shitload of reasons that i can't summarize here. but it started with getting head, and that's the truth."

"5626","calling beneath the video/comment section a dooblydoo is a vlog brothers reference that would've spread through the community like tyler oakley's 'hey whatsup you guys'

"5648","i also think that men often don't understand that a women isnt just a passive subject that is there to be seduced. they decide if they want to have sex or not. you having sex is just a result of her making that decision of 'im going to have sex tonight' earlier in the day. i don't think men understand that 'seduction' often just isn't a thing. the girl looks at you, decides if you're hot enough for the evening, talks to you to see if you're a murderer or not, then decides to go home with you. the seduction part is just 'how to act normal enough to her so she doesn't think i'm a raping pickup artist.'"
"5649","6:15
don't blink!"
"5650","you know, i want role models too. but holy shit, when i see dudes looking at someone like roosh as someone to look up to... man that makes me sad."
"5651","the way those ""alpha males"" talk about sex makes me think that they might be gay or asexual, but they're in denial. men being attracted to other men, or not being interested in sex at all isn't considered ""masculine."" so rather than considering that they don't like sex or aren't attracted to women, they conclude that sex isn't supposed to be enjoyable for men. it's just a disgusting and tedious way to make babies and feel powerful."

"5672","i think there's confusion out there regarding the distinction between pick-up and the larger manosphere. they are obviously intertwined and every normal man wants to get better with women so there's overlap but i would argue that 'pure' pick-up is dead in the 2010's. all the top guys are speaking very holistically and their message is that of positivity and putting a fire in your belly in all areas of life, which are interconnected; it can be compared to substance abuse treatment, criminal rehabilitation or other social work where the focus is on strengthening all areas of life to lead a happier, more productive existence. even the primitive game advice in the 90's, 00' or even prior to the 90's was not about doing some underhanded magician trick that would somehow get a woman to fall in love with you (lol) but owning your sexuality and understanding how intergender social interaction works so that both parties can have a nice experience; let's face it; a woman is not going to go to bed with a man unless he has already evoked positive feelings in her; it's about mutual pleasure. if you're socially awkward, even on the autism spectrum, you may try, try and try and never get a positive experience for either party but when you own your sexuality, commit to self-improvement and understanding female psychology you can have a positive experience even if you get shot down because you now have the balls to go up to a woman and demonstrate interest, which makes her feel good on some level even if she cannot exactly reciprocate completely at the time. as for the exploitation of women thing; it's not real. every guy that commits to game is growing in value and even cool guys with their life together and good social skills (and good heart) get shot down the vast majority of the time; sometimes rudely. women will continue to play dumb and hoard attention from both beta orbiters and the game aware guys whose value is on the rise and the game aware guys will provide the women with validation and good experiences for nothing in return most of the time without making it awkward for the girls because these guys have internalized the abundance mentality and their ego does not rise and fall according to the response of the girl no matter how vitriolic it is so they don't become stalkers or violent. the game aware guys are making the world a better place for everyone through their positive attitude and go-getter mentality. he may not be the best looking guy but if you have a good looking socially unaware blue pill guy and an average looking positive minded game guy in a club what's going to happen? well the woman (looking for male attention, sex and possibly a relationship) will eye the blue pill guy but if they get into a conversation (which is unlikely because the blue pill guy pedestalizes women and is ashamed of his gender) the blue pill guy will make a bunch of subtle social mistakes (nothing heinous, it's just that he cannot lead the interaction and make her lose her socially conditioned inhibitions) that will turn the girl off or gets stuck in the comfort building phase or whatever phase he's uncomfortable with and both the girl and the guy go home frustrated that night."
"5673","nooooo you're murdering those oysters what about the liquor nooooo"
"5674","you're so fucking weird and i love it so much."
"5675","okay, so i'm far from some incubus-esque virtuoso of hanky panky (i've only had like three sexual partners in my 28 years of never-ending existential horror that is life), but i've honestly never understood what's so difficult about unclasping a bra... you just, you know, kinda pinch it and it comes off. even my past girlfriends have seemed taken aback by it, as if i'm working some hellish black sorcery. is it really that difficult for most people? i swear to my lord and master mephistopheles i'm not trying to humble-brag or anything, i really don't give a shit about sexual prowess, i've just always been kind of confused by it always being something that's brought up."

women don't want to be with you, in part due to your ugliness, but also that you act and think like creepy rapists, who care only for themselves. no one wants to hang around a person who thinks women should be given to men by the state.

"5794","the pick up artist mentality almost strikes me as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder. it's no about enjoyment or even about gaining the respect of other males, it's just about repeating a certain act as many times as possible."

"5801","omfg her old videos are so odd to see. what a glow up lmao"
"5802","so what you're telling me is: this guy obsesses over what other guys think of him while having pleasureless sex with random women? and people buy his books to learn how to do this?"
"5803","it's probably a bit transphobic to think like this, but the 'being a man' comments like 'i'm a bit of a man slut myself' were funny"

"5805","it's been amazing how much you've changed in your transition since videos from this time. you look, sound and even gesture way more femininely nowadays."
"5806","unlike these pick up artists i always thought it was important to be good at sex. not only is that just good manners but at least that way when the prospective partner rejects me i know it really *is* her loss, not just mine. 

(also surely quality at sex rather than quantity of sex partners is the real way to be an alpha male.)"

"5817","i've always wondered why pick up artists even exists. i mean it is the fault of toxic masculinity also that men think sex is commodity and you have to have as much as possible to be 'cool' right? it just proves you're a very insecure person obsessed with proving to -god knows who- that you're 'worthy'. maybe to your toxic, insecure bro friends. but idk what do i know."
"5818","props to the clockwork orange reference, and you're absolutely right about oral sex. i rejected my husband when we first started dating, but his cunnilingus alone got me back. i'm not fucking kidding. he's really, really good at it. and that matters. men, take note. you need to be able to to go down on a woman if you want to impress her in bed.

of course, later, the reason our relationship worked was for a shitload of reasons that i can't summarize here. but it started with getting head, and that's the truth."

"5851","the way those ""alpha males"" talk about sex makes me think that they might be gay or asexual, but they're in denial. men being attracted to other men, or not being interested in sex at all isn't considered ""masculine."" so rather than considering that they don't like sex or aren't attracted to women, they conclude that sex isn't supposed to be enjoyable for men. it's just a disgusting and tedious way to make babies and feel powerful."

"5872","i think there's confusion out there regarding the distinction between pick-up and the larger manosphere. they are obviously intertwined and every normal man wants to get better with women so there's overlap but i would argue that 'pure' pick-up is dead in the 2010's. all the top guys are speaking very holistically and their message is that of positivity and putting a fire in your belly in all areas of life, which are interconnected; it can be compared to substance abuse treatment, criminal rehabilitation or other social work where the focus is on strengthening all areas of life to lead a happier, more productive existence. even the primitive game advice in the 90's, 00' or even prior to the 90's was not about doing some underhanded magician trick that would somehow get a woman to fall in love with you (lol) but owning your sexuality and understanding how intergender social interaction works so that both parties can have a nice experience; let's face it; a woman is not going to go to bed with a man unless he has already evoked positive feelings in her; it's about mutual pleasure. if you're socially awkward, even on the autism spectrum, you may try, try and try and never get a positive experience for either party but when you own your sexuality, commit to self-improvement and understanding female psychology you can have a positive experience even if you get shot down because you now have the balls to go up to a woman and demonstrate interest, which makes her feel good on some level even if she cannot exactly reciprocate completely at the time. as for the exploitation of women thing; it's not real. every guy that commits to game is growing in value and even cool guys with their life together and good social skills (and good heart) get shot down the vast majority of the time; sometimes rudely. women will continue to play dumb and hoard attention from both beta orbiters and the game aware guys whose value is on the rise and the game aware guys will provide the women with validation and good experiences for nothing in return most of the time without making it awkward for the girls because these guys have internalized the abundance mentality and their ego does not rise and fall according to the response of the girl no matter how vitriolic it is so they don't become stalkers or violent. the game aware guys are making the world a better place for everyone through their positive attitude and go-getter mentality. he may not be the best looking guy but if you have a good looking socially unaware blue pill guy and an average looking positive minded game guy in a club what's going to happen? well the woman (looking for male attention, sex and possibly a relationship) will eye the blue pill guy but if they get into a conversation (which is unlikely because the blue pill guy pedestalizes women and is ashamed of his gender) the blue pill guy will make a bunch of subtle social mistakes (nothing heinous, it's just that he cannot lead the interaction and make her lose her socially conditioned inhibitions) that will turn the girl off or gets stuck in the comfort building phase or whatever phase he's uncomfortable with and both the girl and the guy go home frustrated that night."

"5875","okay, so i'm far from some incubus-esque virtuoso of hanky panky (i've only had like three sexual partners in my 28 years of never-ending existential horror that is life), but i've honestly never understood what's so difficult about unclasping a bra... you just, you know, kinda pinch it and it comes off. even my past girlfriends have seemed taken aback by it, as if i'm working some hellish black sorcery. is it really that difficult for most people? i swear to my lord and master mephistopheles i'm not trying to humble-brag or anything, i really don't give a shit about sexual prowess, i've just always been kind of confused by it always being something that's brought up."

"5913","it's sad, if they had just delivered the expansion they promised it could have been one of the best. but they cut content until there was nothing left..."
"5914","nice weebstick. lol

(jk i love your videos tbh.)"
"5915","well now i have a real crush on you ;-;

 i just started playing wow seriously after coming off years on ffxiv. i have played trials and on private servers before but wanted time to ""get into"" it. the wow lore seemed fun to a point but i dunno how i feel about the game as a whole, and blizzard's reputation (i do love overwatch though!).......

imo, ff is superior gameplay in every way and also in the sense that the player character is respected as a catalyst/character in the story. it's actually quite disappointing in comparison to wow since i /want/ to like wow just as much."
"5916","on the plus side, my blue-haired, peace-loving and lesbian night identity politics elf was in a strange and bizarre love triangle with yrel and that hot woodcutter that wanders around the garrison - http://i.imgur.com/pab6lnk.png - that was pretty much the entire expansion story arc for me, and it was gripping, steamy stuff."
"5917","omg i had no idea you made wow content ;u; this is rad"
"5918","i mean, i agree with a lot of this video, but i think that the story was absolute garbage long before draenor, and it just started to stand out to a lot of people because the expansion sucked in every other area too.

i mean, wrath, cataclysm & mists featured the orcs acting like the bloodthirsty monsters they were created to be a subversion of, particularly in mists, which featured what was without doubt or subtlety orcish nazis.

garrosh's arc (or lack thereof) is probably the greatest example of how little blizzard cares about its world. they could never decide who he was going to be, or where they were going with him. their decision to turn him into orc hitler seemed to be due to lacking a major antagonist to follow-up deathwing, rather than something they always planned. if that was always their plan, then it speaks to a deep level of incompetence, because the execution could not have been worse if they tried."
"5919","i think the position of the adventurer is really just a matter of preference, but i do agree blizzard's greater mistake is not going all the way with making your character this amazing important commander of the alliance/horde.

if i'm this extremely powerful and respected badass commander then why am i being sent to gather crab claws or some shit for some unimportant npc? it feels so unsatisfying now.

anyway, legion in my opinion is a step-up from wod. i'm not a big fan of the artifact weapon system though."
"5920","...did you see the south park world of warcraft episode?"
"5921","yaaaaas, lich king is the best expansion! (sorry for commenting on an old video, i just had to)"
"5922","i like the idea of an instanced guild garrison. an npc should be the overall commander and you could even just be some kind of lieutenant that is delegated several followers for the missions. it makes no sense for you to be the decision maker when you don't actually make decisions. you don't choose where the base is, you don't chose a strategy to defeat your enemies. so it's stupid."
"5923","that orc thing you mentioned infuriated me as well"
"5924","out of curiosity, what server do you lurk on? tbh i've been looking for like-minded players to chill with, but even that has a difficult bar to reach in an mmorpg."
"5925","play hots!"
"5926","only adding a selfie camera is pretty shit, but holy shit i love that idea?? every game needs the ability to take selfies, plz game devs do this small thing for me"
"5927","i love your content dude. keep killin' it! ^.^

""more good things. less bad things."" best advice ever ^.^"
"5928","on your points about the roles of pcs in wow: they've always felt like vessels to experience the story. even in legion, i don't really feel like i'm affecting the story in any meaningful way, i'm still just kind...there. hey, i'm kind of important now, and all these people recognize my skill, but i'm still just another background character.  

i used to be pretty okay with that approach, until i played other mmos that put more effort in putting you in the story. in ff14, i not only helped save the world, but my character has meaningful relationships with all the main characters, and is recognized for their feats. you start off as a common adventurer and work your way up, and end up becoming a legend.  it's really cool to feel like i'm part of the world, and contributing something to it, rather than ""thanks for killing this boss, but wait there while we show you a 5 minute cut scene of the characters that *really* matter fighting."""
"5929","one of the things i hated about warlords is how static and empty the world felt after leveling. it's not often you have a purely mechanized, modern military foe to fight in wow, why couldn't they take advantage of that and make dailies and weeklies where you had to defend an alliance or horde settlement from iron horde invasion, or botani slavers, or ogre slavers? that way the settlements would actually have a use after leveling."
"5930","illidan ftw bruh"
"5931","was so bored with mop and wod, i literally went off to play private servers for 2-3 years. now i'm back for legion."
"5932","good vid. i liked the raiding in wod (barring some kinks in the scaling system) and because that was pretty much all i did, i felt fairly content for a while. it was only after stepping away for a few months and coming back without a guild to progress alongside that i realized there's absolutely nothing of value to do.

one thing i've always liked about blizzard is that they're consistently good at iterating on their ideas and separating wheat from the chaff. for example: variable raid difficulties can be traced back to zul'aman (where the entire instance was the more casual-friendly option) and all the way through the many system reworks throughout wrath, and after some additional tweaking in each expansion we've now got a pretty good system with difficulty settings for every different kind of raider. it took some time to really get it right, but you can easily retrace each step in hindsight and see what kind of thought process lead them where they are today.

you can see this all over the place with the main features of legion. order halls feel like a home base where the troopers wave at you and whisper to each other about your many heroic exploits without being a barren wasteland with a population of one, and everything you do there (including follower missions, though they're still kinda boring and redundant) is all about getting you out into the world to do stuff. world quests revision the apexis dailies (and daily quests in general by extension) without all the stuff that made apexis dailies terrible. mythic+, on top of being a reiteration of diablo 3's greater rifts and totally awesome, is the latest edition of the system that started out as woefully underwhelming challenge modes. and that's without talking about all the small details like mob tagging. in many ways, legion's initial presentation makes it seem like the expansion that warlords should have been.

blizzard have never been perfect and as almost the entirety of draenor showed, they're not above releasing huge mistakes that never should've seen the light of day. but they've always been consistently good at taking a step back from their mistakes and learning from them for the future. and that is something i can respect."
"5933","i would love to hear your thoughts on leigion now that we're like, like a month in or whatever"
"5934","sup. i've played wow on and off since the beginning, too.

wod may not have had new classes or races, but all the pre-cata races had all of the graphics and animations completely revamped. 6.1 added the missing blood elf revamp as well as the heirloom system revamp which people had been requesting for ages, rightfully so, because the old system was awful.
i'd say both of the most hated expansions feature big updates or revamps on old things that at the time could be called archaic at best. people used to think that cataclysm was outright horrible, and they revamped both of the old continents for that one. diverting time and resources to updating these things makes the rest of the game suffer for sure.

i do see the point in liking the whole ""you're just another no-name adventurer"" approach that the previous expansions had, there was always a huge disconnect in defeating some of the most famous characters in warcraft only to be yelled at by drill sergeants by the next expansion. from the dragon aspects singing your praises at the end of cataclysm to nazgrim bossing you around when shit goes wrong in pandaria. though i will say that the current way things are going feels way beyond overkill, where the player character keeps interacting with every single important character ever to have appeared in the lore.

having only three raids in the entire expansion really is quite criminal though.

...and time & dimensional travel is really fucking stupid."
"5935","i will say that wod's raiding was pretty good. not amazing, but i enjoyed it. everything else you said is accurate though.

except mop was the best expac, not wrath."
"5936","great video, good humour, valid points - here's hoping for a better legion."
"5937","ooooooooooooooookay, so much for this channel... alliance and gnomes, that is too hard a hit for your reputation in my eyes."

be vigilant, and we'll give you a safe passageway in the wastelands. 
be vigilant, and there will be an end to the horror."
"5946","i think the reasons behind racial iq differences is a mix between nature and nurture tbh. some people's will naturally be inclined towards higher iq but upbringing is a massive influence."
"5947","how do we explain the high iq of mongolians? mongol master race!"
"5948","i dont think excersing your privilege makes you a racist. everyone is an opportunist, and most of us would want to get out of trouble. what is racist is thinking that these privileges should be exclusive to your race."
"5949","haha wrong wrong all over"
"5950","another thing to keep in mind.

on average black americans do more violent crimes and murders than africans of all african countries except two; lesotho and south africa.

so, in order to find more violent and murderous black people than african-american, you have to go to the corner of africa where the segregation, oppression and general treatment were worse than in the us. african-americans do not primarily commit more violent crimes than european-americans because of genetics, it's evident that social issues has an effect on the statistics. developing countries are usually found to be more violent than developed nations, yet the us is an exception, and we have to ask why that is.

the whole ""blacks are genetically more likely to be violent criminals"" argument falls when you look at statistics in africa, and when you look at well integrated black people in progressive european countries.

you know i've debated a lot of alt-right people who push this ""blacks are more violent"" narrative, and when-ever i bring up the statistics showing this is mostly only true in countries where black people have experienced oppression, you know what happens? they shut up. not one single racist has managed to even say a single word back to that, so far.

another phenomenon is that freed american slaves who were sent to liberia are known to be more violent than the local liberians. oppression has an effect on people, and the effect doesn't magically go away after a couple of generations, it takes socio-political actions to mend the wrong.

the american phenomenon of black people committing more violent crimes and murders is not a case of genetics, it's evidently not when comparing america with other countries across the world. it becomes obvious that it's a case of social issues. so, in order to solve the problem, the only thing which would prove effective was to start with efforts on mending the wrongs, fighting institutional racism, integrating communities, and increasing efforts on education, welfare and jobs for black people. it might seem unfair if black americans were to start getting better treatment, but, no matter how unfair it might seem it's the right way to decrease violent crimes. which are often black-on-black crimes, so blacks are not only the perpetrators, often they are the victims as well."
"5951","it's crazy when you think about how far we have come in a short period of time. and people who argue that we have completely overcome racism seem to think that how far we have indeed come isn't all that impressive and they expect that we have come a whole lot further than we actually have..."
"5952","i was born and raised in argentina, in a privileged environment, and was taught unofficially that ""blacks"" were criminals, not actually blacks because those got completely wiped out in independence and civil wars as cannon fodder, and later in an epidemic, but native american descendants. this "" knowledge"" was somehow confirned by the fact that getting robbed is a common thing as a school kid in argentina, and most times it was actually ""blacks"". however, i somehow didn't want to believe that it was race related. eventually, i realized that it kind of makes sense that this particular group has a higher tendency to crime, because they have been sistematically brutalized, exploited and neglected, they are the most vulnerable sector of society, and because of that, some of them are more likely to turn to crime. if i was living a shitty life, in a society that hates me for who i am, and with almost no chances of improving my situation, i would likely turn to robbery... what is there to loose"

not to mention that black american people are statistically of lower economic status than people of other ethnicities. when you couple this fact with the fact that public school funding in america is determined by the property values in the surrounding school district, you still have a majority of black american students required to go to lower quality, underfunded schools."

"5963","they should look at genetics instead of just looking at how they identify.  take the crime stats of people who identify as black and compare them with those who identify as white but have similar levels of sub saharan african dna; this should tease out the social factors that may lead to higher crime.  interestingly, the parts of the u.s. with the highest levels of far-right white supremacist terrorists, the south, are also the parts with the highest levels of hidden sub saharan african dna in whites.  
such a study would have scary implications though.  what if there is a genetic influence?  are we better off not knowing?"

"5969","the problem most people have is that they just assume racial reasons rather than sociological, economic, historical, or really any other context whatsoever. black people are not better at basketball because of genetics, they are better because in inner cities its literally the only sport than anyone can play. inner city black poverty means they cant afford swimming, tennis, etc.. just basketball. they also see it as a way out of their poverty so it becomes even more emphasized. the best boxers in the world used to be irish, then jewish, italian -- but those groups largely don't box because there is less poverty in those groups before. asians being good at sats -- there are entire threads and papers written about the myth of the model minority and why this is the case, and again the reasoning is not genetic -- its cutural and sociological as well as eocnomic."

perhaps if we create a self-replicating artificial intelligence or end up with a bunch of refugees from some distant planet that need a planet with oxygen, sunlight and liquid water and we say ""yeah, ok, you guys can stay here"", we might end up with more than one 'race' and we can talk about comparative strengths and weaknesses then. but until that happens, we've just got the one race to contend with.

"5980","great video. it gets tiresome seeing these lazy arguments crop up in every corner of the internet. i'm somewhat confused by your reaction to dawkins' comments, though. if i understand him right, he's criticizing the people who fail to distinguish between pedophiles who are child molesters, and pedophiles who know they are sick don't act on their attraction, instead coming to the intellectually lazy conclusion that they all deserve to die. people should be able to recognize varying degrees of badness, rather than generalizing with one broad brush and avoiding all nuance. i'd be interested in what your specific problems are with his comments. your response of telling him to ""just shut up"" seemed jarringly out of place in an otherwise eloquent and incisive analysis."
"5981","i dunno, it sounds to me like dawkins was trying to say that while rape at knifepoint is worse than date rape, that doesn't make date rape not bad, as evidenced by the very next line ""if you think that's an endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think."" to me it comes across as him pointing out that while there are degrees of awful, that doesn't somehow make the less awful things not still awful. i have had the displeasure of coming across folks on the internet who seem to dismiss less bad things because ""hey it could have been so much worse"" and with that context (admittedly a context i'm assuming) those tweets seem far less horrible. just my 2 cents."

arguing against that interpretation is being unscientific. in reality, the people using certain statistics to push their particular interpretation of a situation are often the ones trying to avoid going into reasons in any depth."

thank you so much for opening my mind and harboring such cool people on your channel so that i can go check out their sweet content! of course now i have it ingrained into me that we all have our biases and goofs and that i shouldn't really look to even a single group or perspective to take off all the fabric on reality and finally see it for what it is. 

personally this has actually been quite difficult to my mental illness! one day i was called an incel and even after being quite insulted went on an incel forum and respected the person who called me that word even though they weren't very polite or understanding about telling me so.  that specific moment which made me feel i should have respect for that person was what opened me up initially, and i thank you again for posting these very entertaining and interesting videos which have helped me think more about these  statistic statements."

""being right isn't an excuse for being a prick"" this statement just shows the fundamental flaw with videos like these.  it's sentiments like these that breed cognitive dissonance.

"5993","fucking brilliant"
"5994","the point you make around 8:03 is a good one and i understand where you're coming from completely. however there are many many factors contributing to why black people are more likely to commit crime, and it's not just that there are more police encounters with them. on the south side of chicago, police rarely go there anymore because it's so dangerous. same thing in compton, ca. it's a mix of poverty, drug abuse, and recovery from years of oppression in the country. it's so many different things that it's hard to know where to start to fix it. thank you for making this video though, you're very intelligent and make awesome points!"
"5995","so what about statistics? poor idiots are probably going to breed poor idiots. if you grow up in a house where 10,000 words are regurgitated, you'll most likely be less intellegent than someone who grew up in a household that uses 100,000 words."
"5996","while i agree that you should be careful of unqualified statements because they can be hurtful, i do not agree with the condescending tone that is accompanied by the attitude that ""shaun"" displays. he is basically saying: you may not say thing like ""blacks commit more crimes"", because i know that there are many factors that contribute to this, but others are too dumb to know this! and so would come to the wrong conclusion.

this thinking is typical for someone who believes in censorship: somehow there is an elite (and i am one of them) that knows better and therefore can say what should and should not be said, because the dumb masses are not able to think critically (unlike me of course!).

growing up in sa in the 70's, pornography and nudity in films was not allowed. but as a teenager i knew there was some guy at the censorship board who was watching all the films and cutting out the parts we in the population were not allowed to see. i wondered why he was allowed to see things i (or anyone else) was not allowed to see! what qualified him as being ""incorruptible"", while we were not. nothing. of course, and that is my point!

political correctness and other forms of censorship is a way simply of saying ""i know better than you, so shut up because""! the libertarian, on the other hand, says let people make statements like ""blacks commit more crimes"", but allow all voices to be heard, and let people decide for themselves what the truth is. if the random ""joe"" who made this video is able to decide that there are many factors that lead to this, then why should not everyone else?"
"5997","william a. black points out that white collar crime (regardless of race, but) accounts for more financial losses than all other forms of property crime combined.

yet, i think it's functionally accurate that black males in particular, commit a significantly higher number of violent crimes, armed robbery, murders, etc. than do white males.  at least that is what statistical records show us for the number of solved violent crimes where race of the perpetrator is known.  we can think about the question of the degree to which black males with crappy attorneys and biased criminal justice systems are more likely to plead guilty to severe violent crimes they did not commit, but that is nearly impossible to determine.
we do know that violent crime rates are higher in certain heavily black regions -- which are associated with poverty -- including against black victims -- and this is unlikely to be due to white criminals invading the hood like ninjas to commit murder.
so, we can think about a number of other social factors that don't include any average genetic propensity towards impulsiveness.
-------------
i recently read an article by a black writer i think in the atlantic, who was suitably pro-black, but he wrote as an iconoclast on the mainstream brown vs board story.  one history site explained that naacp etc. included brown/kansas as the lead name above 4 other cases so it would not seem like a purely north vs south issue. 
this black writer pointed out that oliver brown did not want to be part of this controversial case and that the majority of black people in topeka ks were *opposed to sending their black children to white schools* with white teachers and white students.  they wanted what they already had, just a bit more money or less distance and easier travel, but they felt much more comfortable with black teachers caring for their black children and did not feel that their school was ""inferior"". 
in contrast, the other schools named in the case in washington dc and south carolina etc *did* have inferior conditions for black schools."
"5998","at minute 8:00 you say that a ""spiral"" occurs because the more crime that you ""discover"" due to more policing leads to more policing, which leads to the discovery of more crime. this is nonsense for 2 reasons: firstly, you cannot discover more crime than is actually there so this cannot be a never ending spiral. secondly, more policing must actually lead to less crime, not more. so the ""spiral"" should reverse itself, which means in your example there is actual pressure on the statistic to go the other way!

in actually fact, what you are really trying to do is blame the higher crime rate of blacks on systemic racism.

so, i here is an example that you cannot ""spin"" the way you want: ""the offending [homicide] rate for african americans was [from 1980 to 2008] almost 8 times higher than european americans"" (from wikipedia ""race and crime in the united states""). now since every murders to be investigated equally be police whether the perpetrator is black or white (!), is unlikely due to any police bias. the fact that the rate is 800% and not your theoretically 20% shows that there is also a real difference.

sure you can continue to cry ""lies, lies and statistics"" but while you do that the adults will be working on the real world problems that these statistic indicate."

"6036","""black people are more likely to be criminals than white people [in america]""

it's clear here that ""more likely"" is referring to a statistical circumstance. you then go on to completely dismiss the idea that genetics could be involved (because that's the domain of the ""kkk""), without actually examining whether or not genetics can play a role on human behavior, or influence any of a number of factors which increase the likelihood of someone committing a crime. i'm not going to make the argument that yes, blacks are *genetically* more predisposed to commit crimes, because causes of crime are quite complex (there are quite a few variables and you'd be a fool to assume that some congenital characteristic neatly explains the variance) and this isn't at all a good way to discuss whether there are some important differences between races as cohorts.

the sat is a much better example, but the sat isn't as free from cultural bias as the best iq tests, which is where i would really like to focus on. nevertheless, i think the sat scores are a good proxy as they are strongly correlated with iq. let's leave aside the comparison with blacks right now, and compare asian performance to *white* performance.

at this point in the video, i'd like to point out that it's a bit annoying you apparently didn't actually do any research, or at least, cite studies while you were making specific claims. one problem with this fly-by-the-wire approach is that your own cognitive biases are laid bare rather quickly: you automatically assume some sort of structural reason for success instead of even *entertaining* the notion that, eg, success in academics might have something to do with biology/genetics the way every other trait is.

for example, your construction of ""parental (academic achievement + financial means) = child's (academic achievement)"" doesn't quite fit the pattern of how asians historically integrated into american society. at one point, despite lacking formal academic achievement and financial success on the same scale that whites enjoyed, asians started punching above their weight. clearly, there must be some factor(s) besides the structural causes that you gave.

i'll give you a hint, and this is probably where you should have started your research: what is the validity of iq as a measurement of intelligence? what are the factors influencing iq, and can we say whether or not iq can be genetically inherited? what exactly does iq predict in terms of real world outcomes- does it predict success in school? in the workplace?

i'd recommend you actually dig through the available scientific literature on the subject- fortunately, it's quite extensive, and there are clear conclusions that can be made (while other conclusions have insufficient support to be answered either in the affirmative or the negative).

for all of your considerable skill in breaking down a complex argument, it's a shame that you get lost in the weeds simply because you don't have a map. then again, maybe you don't really *want* to know what the terrain is because you'd be radically unprepared to face reality. i hope that isn't the case"

"6045","watched the whole video and yeah i get this is like over a year and a half old but ...................
so i've spent a good portion of time re writing this comment.  only to find that fundamentally i agree with you. most of that rewriting came before an organization of thoughts. instead i now would say that i agree. i'm posting this here because i think it's a more important message to anyone who may read or see this. because you may spend your time  which in my case was about an hour, arguing against something you agree with.  in today's society we are led by pretty much every form of media, some sort of narrative. whether malicious or not. that is a super nondescript statement which is the point. see. i disagreed with you saying that pretty much anyone who's had any meaningful interactions with greater society has some subconscious racial biases. my argument being..... it would never cross my mind and that i think that with internet culture and the access of information to youth that it could in the future possibly yield nonbiased people due anonymity and due to the ability to rise to prevelance on a platform such as youtube regardless of race nationality, gender identity, sexuality, beliefs, or even income. i also argued that there could also be literal nazis from the same thing and the wide spectrum between.....but that really doesn't say anything about what the video said. as i said i really had to re think my argument to the current world and yes i think the way greater society is currently built we are given small messages constantly to think certain things of a race, whether intended/negative/ or not. such as, asians are better at taking sats..though as the video points out...i don't think i literally need to restate the whole video.

 so morale of the story anyone who reads this. think about things before blurting them out, because you never know you could be arguing something either completely irrelevant or even on the same side as the person you were arguing with. or in my case both, to which in my defense it's two in the morning. so i guess add that to the list probably not the smartest idea to make a response to a video when you're very tired."

"6050","another thing to keep in mind.

on average black americans do more violent crimes and murders than africans of all african countries except two; lesotho and south africa.

so, in order to find more violent and murderous black people than african-american, you have to go to the corner of africa where the segregation, oppression and general treatment were worse than in the us. african-americans do not primarily commit more violent crimes than european-americans because of genetics, it's evident that social issues has an effect on the statistics. developing countries are usually found to be more violent than developed nations, yet the us is an exception, and we have to ask why that is.

the whole ""blacks are genetically more likely to be violent criminals"" argument falls when you look at statistics in africa, and when you look at well integrated black people in progressive european countries.

you know i've debated a lot of alt-right people who push this ""blacks are more violent"" narrative, and when-ever i bring up the statistics showing this is mostly only true in countries where black people have experienced oppression, you know what happens? they shut up. not one single racist has managed to even say a single word back to that, so far.

another phenomenon is that freed american slaves who were sent to liberia are known to be more violent than the local liberians. oppression has an effect on people, and the effect doesn't magically go away after a couple of generations, it takes socio-political actions to mend the wrong.

the american phenomenon of black people committing more violent crimes and murders is not a case of genetics, it's evidently not when comparing america with other countries across the world. it becomes obvious that it's a case of social issues. so, in order to solve the problem, the only thing which would prove effective was to start with efforts on mending the wrongs, fighting institutional racism, integrating communities, and increasing efforts on education, welfare and jobs for black people. it might seem unfair if black americans were to start getting better treatment, but, no matter how unfair it might seem it's the right way to decrease violent crimes. which are often black-on-black crimes, so blacks are not only the perpetrators, often they are the victims as well."
"6051","it's crazy when you think about how far we have come in a short period of time. and people who argue that we have completely overcome racism seem to think that how far we have indeed come isn't all that impressive and they expect that we have come a whole lot further than we actually have..."

"6069","the problem most people have is that they just assume racial reasons rather than sociological, economic, historical, or really any other context whatsoever. black people are not better at basketball because of genetics, they are better because in inner cities its literally the only sport than anyone can play. inner city black poverty means they cant afford swimming, tennis, etc.. just basketball. they also see it as a way out of their poverty so it becomes even more emphasized. the best boxers in the world used to be irish, then jewish, italian -- but those groups largely don't box because there is less poverty in those groups before. asians being good at sats -- there are entire threads and papers written about the myth of the model minority and why this is the case, and again the reasoning is not genetic -- its cutural and sociological as well as eocnomic."

perhaps if we create a self-replicating artificial intelligence or end up with a bunch of refugees from some distant planet that need a planet with oxygen, sunlight and liquid water and we say ""yeah, ok, you guys can stay here"", we might end up with more than one 'race' and we can talk about comparative strengths and weaknesses then. but until that happens, we've just got the one race to contend with.

"6080","great video. it gets tiresome seeing these lazy arguments crop up in every corner of the internet. i'm somewhat confused by your reaction to dawkins' comments, though. if i understand him right, he's criticizing the people who fail to distinguish between pedophiles who are child molesters, and pedophiles who know they are sick don't act on their attraction, instead coming to the intellectually lazy conclusion that they all deserve to die. people should be able to recognize varying degrees of badness, rather than generalizing with one broad brush and avoiding all nuance. i'd be interested in what your specific problems are with his comments. your response of telling him to ""just shut up"" seemed jarringly out of place in an otherwise eloquent and incisive analysis."
"6081","i dunno, it sounds to me like dawkins was trying to say that while rape at knifepoint is worse than date rape, that doesn't make date rape not bad, as evidenced by the very next line ""if you think that's an endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think."" to me it comes across as him pointing out that while there are degrees of awful, that doesn't somehow make the less awful things not still awful. i have had the displeasure of coming across folks on the internet who seem to dismiss less bad things because ""hey it could have been so much worse"" and with that context (admittedly a context i'm assuming) those tweets seem far less horrible. just my 2 cents."

thank you so much for opening my mind and harboring such cool people on your channel so that i can go check out their sweet content! of course now i have it ingrained into me that we all have our biases and goofs and that i shouldn't really look to even a single group or perspective to take off all the fabric on reality and finally see it for what it is. 

personally this has actually been quite difficult to my mental illness! one day i was called an incel and even after being quite insulted went on an incel forum and respected the person who called me that word even though they weren't very polite or understanding about telling me so.  that specific moment which made me feel i should have respect for that person was what opened me up initially, and i thank you again for posting these very entertaining and interesting videos which have helped me think more about these  statistic statements."

""being right isn't an excuse for being a prick"" this statement just shows the fundamental flaw with videos like these.  it's sentiments like these that breed cognitive dissonance.

"6094","the point you make around 8:03 is a good one and i understand where you're coming from completely. however there are many many factors contributing to why black people are more likely to commit crime, and it's not just that there are more police encounters with them. on the south side of chicago, police rarely go there anymore because it's so dangerous. same thing in compton, ca. it's a mix of poverty, drug abuse, and recovery from years of oppression in the country. it's so many different things that it's hard to know where to start to fix it. thank you for making this video though, you're very intelligent and make awesome points!"
"6095","so what about statistics? poor idiots are probably going to breed poor idiots. if you grow up in a house where 10,000 words are regurgitated, you'll most likely be less intellegent than someone who grew up in a household that uses 100,000 words."
"6096","while i agree that you should be careful of unqualified statements because they can be hurtful, i do not agree with the condescending tone that is accompanied by the attitude that ""shaun"" displays. he is basically saying: you may not say thing like ""blacks commit more crimes"", because i know that there are many factors that contribute to this, but others are too dumb to know this! and so would come to the wrong conclusion.

this thinking is typical for someone who believes in censorship: somehow there is an elite (and i am one of them) that knows better and therefore can say what should and should not be said, because the dumb masses are not able to think critically (unlike me of course!).

growing up in sa in the 70's, pornography and nudity in films was not allowed. but as a teenager i knew there was some guy at the censorship board who was watching all the films and cutting out the parts we in the population were not allowed to see. i wondered why he was allowed to see things i (or anyone else) was not allowed to see! what qualified him as being ""incorruptible"", while we were not. nothing. of course, and that is my point!

political correctness and other forms of censorship is a way simply of saying ""i know better than you, so shut up because""! the libertarian, on the other hand, says let people make statements like ""blacks commit more crimes"", but allow all voices to be heard, and let people decide for themselves what the truth is. if the random ""joe"" who made this video is able to decide that there are many factors that lead to this, then why should not everyone else?"
"6097","william a. black points out that white collar crime (regardless of race, but) accounts for more financial losses than all other forms of property crime combined.

yet, i think it's functionally accurate that black males in particular, commit a significantly higher number of violent crimes, armed robbery, murders, etc. than do white males.  at least that is what statistical records show us for the number of solved violent crimes where race of the perpetrator is known.  we can think about the question of the degree to which black males with crappy attorneys and biased criminal justice systems are more likely to plead guilty to severe violent crimes they did not commit, but that is nearly impossible to determine.
we do know that violent crime rates are higher in certain heavily black regions -- which are associated with poverty -- including against black victims -- and this is unlikely to be due to white criminals invading the hood like ninjas to commit murder.
so, we can think about a number of other social factors that don't include any average genetic propensity towards impulsiveness.
-------------
i recently read an article by a black writer i think in the atlantic, who was suitably pro-black, but he wrote as an iconoclast on the mainstream brown vs board story.  one history site explained that naacp etc. included brown/kansas as the lead name above 4 other cases so it would not seem like a purely north vs south issue. 
this black writer pointed out that oliver brown did not want to be part of this controversial case and that the majority of black people in topeka ks were *opposed to sending their black children to white schools* with white teachers and white students.  they wanted what they already had, just a bit more money or less distance and easier travel, but they felt much more comfortable with black teachers caring for their black children and did not feel that their school was ""inferior"". 
in contrast, the other schools named in the case in washington dc and south carolina etc *did* have inferior conditions for black schools."
"6098","at minute 8:00 you say that a ""spiral"" occurs because the more crime that you ""discover"" due to more policing leads to more policing, which leads to the discovery of more crime. this is nonsense for 2 reasons: firstly, you cannot discover more crime than is actually there so this cannot be a never ending spiral. secondly, more policing must actually lead to less crime, not more. so the ""spiral"" should reverse itself, which means in your example there is actual pressure on the statistic to go the other way!

in actually fact, what you are really trying to do is blame the higher crime rate of blacks on systemic racism.

so, i here is an example that you cannot ""spin"" the way you want: ""the offending [homicide] rate for african americans was [from 1980 to 2008] almost 8 times higher than european americans"" (from wikipedia ""race and crime in the united states""). now since every murders to be investigated equally be police whether the perpetrator is black or white (!), is unlikely due to any police bias. the fact that the rate is 800% and not your theoretically 20% shows that there is also a real difference.

sure you can continue to cry ""lies, lies and statistics"" but while you do that the adults will be working on the real world problems that these statistic indicate."

is he a prick for thinking that, while two things can be horrible, he can still think one is more horrible than the other, and that this doesn't make the other thing any less horrible (the point he was trying to make), or because he picked an example that rubbed people the wrong way, which it ultimately did exactly because both things in his example were indeed horrible?"

"6136","""black people are more likely to be criminals than white people [in america]""

it's clear here that ""more likely"" is referring to a statistical circumstance. you then go on to completely dismiss the idea that genetics could be involved (because that's the domain of the ""kkk""), without actually examining whether or not genetics can play a role on human behavior, or influence any of a number of factors which increase the likelihood of someone committing a crime. i'm not going to make the argument that yes, blacks are *genetically* more predisposed to commit crimes, because causes of crime are quite complex (there are quite a few variables and you'd be a fool to assume that some congenital characteristic neatly explains the variance) and this isn't at all a good way to discuss whether there are some important differences between races as cohorts.

the sat is a much better example, but the sat isn't as free from cultural bias as the best iq tests, which is where i would really like to focus on. nevertheless, i think the sat scores are a good proxy as they are strongly correlated with iq. let's leave aside the comparison with blacks right now, and compare asian performance to *white* performance.

at this point in the video, i'd like to point out that it's a bit annoying you apparently didn't actually do any research, or at least, cite studies while you were making specific claims. one problem with this fly-by-the-wire approach is that your own cognitive biases are laid bare rather quickly: you automatically assume some sort of structural reason for success instead of even *entertaining* the notion that, eg, success in academics might have something to do with biology/genetics the way every other trait is.

for example, your construction of ""parental (academic achievement + financial means) = child's (academic achievement)"" doesn't quite fit the pattern of how asians historically integrated into american society. at one point, despite lacking formal academic achievement and financial success on the same scale that whites enjoyed, asians started punching above their weight. clearly, there must be some factor(s) besides the structural causes that you gave.

i'll give you a hint, and this is probably where you should have started your research: what is the validity of iq as a measurement of intelligence? what are the factors influencing iq, and can we say whether or not iq can be genetically inherited? what exactly does iq predict in terms of real world outcomes- does it predict success in school? in the workplace?

i'd recommend you actually dig through the available scientific literature on the subject- fortunately, it's quite extensive, and there are clear conclusions that can be made (while other conclusions have insufficient support to be answered either in the affirmative or the negative).

for all of your considerable skill in breaking down a complex argument, it's a shame that you get lost in the weeds simply because you don't have a map. then again, maybe you don't really *want* to know what the terrain is because you'd be radically unprepared to face reality. i hope that isn't the case"

"6145","watched the whole video and yeah i get this is like over a year and a half old but ...................
so i've spent a good portion of time re writing this comment.  only to find that fundamentally i agree with you. most of that rewriting came before an organization of thoughts. instead i now would say that i agree. i'm posting this here because i think it's a more important message to anyone who may read or see this. because you may spend your time  which in my case was about an hour, arguing against something you agree with.  in today's society we are led by pretty much every form of media, some sort of narrative. whether malicious or not. that is a super nondescript statement which is the point. see. i disagreed with you saying that pretty much anyone who's had any meaningful interactions with greater society has some subconscious racial biases. my argument being..... it would never cross my mind and that i think that with internet culture and the access of information to youth that it could in the future possibly yield nonbiased people due anonymity and due to the ability to rise to prevelance on a platform such as youtube regardless of race nationality, gender identity, sexuality, beliefs, or even income. i also argued that there could also be literal nazis from the same thing and the wide spectrum between.....but that really doesn't say anything about what the video said. as i said i really had to re think my argument to the current world and yes i think the way greater society is currently built we are given small messages constantly to think certain things of a race, whether intended/negative/ or not. such as, asians are better at taking sats..though as the video points out...i don't think i literally need to restate the whole video.

 so morale of the story anyone who reads this. think about things before blurting them out, because you never know you could be arguing something either completely irrelevant or even on the same side as the person you were arguing with. or in my case both, to which in my defense it's two in the morning. so i guess add that to the list probably not the smartest idea to make a response to a video when you're very tired."

"6150","another thing to keep in mind.

on average black americans do more violent crimes and murders than africans of all african countries except two; lesotho and south africa.

so, in order to find more violent and murderous black people than african-american, you have to go to the corner of africa where the segregation, oppression and general treatment were worse than in the us. african-americans do not primarily commit more violent crimes than european-americans because of genetics, it's evident that social issues has an effect on the statistics. developing countries are usually found to be more violent than developed nations, yet the us is an exception, and we have to ask why that is.

the whole ""blacks are genetically more likely to be violent criminals"" argument falls when you look at statistics in africa, and when you look at well integrated black people in progressive european countries.

you know i've debated a lot of alt-right people who push this ""blacks are more violent"" narrative, and when-ever i bring up the statistics showing this is mostly only true in countries where black people have experienced oppression, you know what happens? they shut up. not one single racist has managed to even say a single word back to that, so far.

another phenomenon is that freed american slaves who were sent to liberia are known to be more violent than the local liberians. oppression has an effect on people, and the effect doesn't magically go away after a couple of generations, it takes socio-political actions to mend the wrong.

the american phenomenon of black people committing more violent crimes and murders is not a case of genetics, it's evidently not when comparing america with other countries across the world. it becomes obvious that it's a case of social issues. so, in order to solve the problem, the only thing which would prove effective was to start with efforts on mending the wrongs, fighting institutional racism, integrating communities, and increasing efforts on education, welfare and jobs for black people. it might seem unfair if black americans were to start getting better treatment, but, no matter how unfair it might seem it's the right way to decrease violent crimes. which are often black-on-black crimes, so blacks are not only the perpetrators, often they are the victims as well."
"6151","it's crazy when you think about how far we have come in a short period of time. and people who argue that we have completely overcome racism seem to think that how far we have indeed come isn't all that impressive and they expect that we have come a whole lot further than we actually have..."

"6169","the problem most people have is that they just assume racial reasons rather than sociological, economic, historical, or really any other context whatsoever. black people are not better at basketball because of genetics, they are better because in inner cities its literally the only sport than anyone can play. inner city black poverty means they cant afford swimming, tennis, etc.. just basketball. they also see it as a way out of their poverty so it becomes even more emphasized. the best boxers in the world used to be irish, then jewish, italian -- but those groups largely don't box because there is less poverty in those groups before. asians being good at sats -- there are entire threads and papers written about the myth of the model minority and why this is the case, and again the reasoning is not genetic -- its cutural and sociological as well as eocnomic."

"6194","the point you make around 8:03 is a good one and i understand where you're coming from completely. however there are many many factors contributing to why black people are more likely to commit crime, and it's not just that there are more police encounters with them. on the south side of chicago, police rarely go there anymore because it's so dangerous. same thing in compton, ca. it's a mix of poverty, drug abuse, and recovery from years of oppression in the country. it's so many different things that it's hard to know where to start to fix it. thank you for making this video though, you're very intelligent and make awesome points!"
"6195","so what about statistics? poor idiots are probably going to breed poor idiots. if you grow up in a house where 10,000 words are regurgitated, you'll most likely be less intellegent than someone who grew up in a household that uses 100,000 words."
"6196","while i agree that you should be careful of unqualified statements because they can be hurtful, i do not agree with the condescending tone that is accompanied by the attitude that ""shaun"" displays. he is basically saying: you may not say thing like ""blacks commit more crimes"", because i know that there are many factors that contribute to this, but others are too dumb to know this! and so would come to the wrong conclusion.

this thinking is typical for someone who believes in censorship: somehow there is an elite (and i am one of them) that knows better and therefore can say what should and should not be said, because the dumb masses are not able to think critically (unlike me of course!).

growing up in sa in the 70's, pornography and nudity in films was not allowed. but as a teenager i knew there was some guy at the censorship board who was watching all the films and cutting out the parts we in the population were not allowed to see. i wondered why he was allowed to see things i (or anyone else) was not allowed to see! what qualified him as being ""incorruptible"", while we were not. nothing. of course, and that is my point!

political correctness and other forms of censorship is a way simply of saying ""i know better than you, so shut up because""! the libertarian, on the other hand, says let people make statements like ""blacks commit more crimes"", but allow all voices to be heard, and let people decide for themselves what the truth is. if the random ""joe"" who made this video is able to decide that there are many factors that lead to this, then why should not everyone else?"
"6197","william a. black points out that white collar crime (regardless of race, but) accounts for more financial losses than all other forms of property crime combined.

yet, i think it's functionally accurate that black males in particular, commit a significantly higher number of violent crimes, armed robbery, murders, etc. than do white males.  at least that is what statistical records show us for the number of solved violent crimes where race of the perpetrator is known.  we can think about the question of the degree to which black males with crappy attorneys and biased criminal justice systems are more likely to plead guilty to severe violent crimes they did not commit, but that is nearly impossible to determine.
we do know that violent crime rates are higher in certain heavily black regions -- which are associated with poverty -- including against black victims -- and this is unlikely to be due to white criminals invading the hood like ninjas to commit murder.
so, we can think about a number of other social factors that don't include any average genetic propensity towards impulsiveness.
-------------
i recently read an article by a black writer i think in the atlantic, who was suitably pro-black, but he wrote as an iconoclast on the mainstream brown vs board story.  one history site explained that naacp etc. included brown/kansas as the lead name above 4 other cases so it would not seem like a purely north vs south issue. 
this black writer pointed out that oliver brown did not want to be part of this controversial case and that the majority of black people in topeka ks were *opposed to sending their black children to white schools* with white teachers and white students.  they wanted what they already had, just a bit more money or less distance and easier travel, but they felt much more comfortable with black teachers caring for their black children and did not feel that their school was ""inferior"". 
in contrast, the other schools named in the case in washington dc and south carolina etc *did* have inferior conditions for black schools."
"6198","at minute 8:00 you say that a ""spiral"" occurs because the more crime that you ""discover"" due to more policing leads to more policing, which leads to the discovery of more crime. this is nonsense for 2 reasons: firstly, you cannot discover more crime than is actually there so this cannot be a never ending spiral. secondly, more policing must actually lead to less crime, not more. so the ""spiral"" should reverse itself, which means in your example there is actual pressure on the statistic to go the other way!

in actually fact, what you are really trying to do is blame the higher crime rate of blacks on systemic racism.

so, i here is an example that you cannot ""spin"" the way you want: ""the offending [homicide] rate for african americans was [from 1980 to 2008] almost 8 times higher than european americans"" (from wikipedia ""race and crime in the united states""). now since every murders to be investigated equally be police whether the perpetrator is black or white (!), is unlikely due to any police bias. the fact that the rate is 800% and not your theoretically 20% shows that there is also a real difference.

sure you can continue to cry ""lies, lies and statistics"" but while you do that the adults will be working on the real world problems that these statistic indicate."

if you're interested in an objective assessment of your personal level of subconscious bias on race, age, weight or other factors, you should take the harvard implicit association test (link included above). it's a psychological task that uses objective measures to estimate implicit bias through a clever method that is explained completely  after the test. if you don't believe you have any implicit biases, then i challenge you to take all the tests to see if you can confirm your perfect subconscious objectivity. honestly,  i urge everyone to take these tests or at least one because the tasks are easy and game-like, and yet the results provide fascinating insights into your personal subconscious biases that are well worth spending the 10 minutes that a single test requires."

"6236","""black people are more likely to be criminals than white people [in america]""

it's clear here that ""more likely"" is referring to a statistical circumstance. you then go on to completely dismiss the idea that genetics could be involved (because that's the domain of the ""kkk""), without actually examining whether or not genetics can play a role on human behavior, or influence any of a number of factors which increase the likelihood of someone committing a crime. i'm not going to make the argument that yes, blacks are *genetically* more predisposed to commit crimes, because causes of crime are quite complex (there are quite a few variables and you'd be a fool to assume that some congenital characteristic neatly explains the variance) and this isn't at all a good way to discuss whether there are some important differences between races as cohorts.

the sat is a much better example, but the sat isn't as free from cultural bias as the best iq tests, which is where i would really like to focus on. nevertheless, i think the sat scores are a good proxy as they are strongly correlated with iq. let's leave aside the comparison with blacks right now, and compare asian performance to *white* performance.

at this point in the video, i'd like to point out that it's a bit annoying you apparently didn't actually do any research, or at least, cite studies while you were making specific claims. one problem with this fly-by-the-wire approach is that your own cognitive biases are laid bare rather quickly: you automatically assume some sort of structural reason for success instead of even *entertaining* the notion that, eg, success in academics might have something to do with biology/genetics the way every other trait is.

for example, your construction of ""parental (academic achievement + financial means) = child's (academic achievement)"" doesn't quite fit the pattern of how asians historically integrated into american society. at one point, despite lacking formal academic achievement and financial success on the same scale that whites enjoyed, asians started punching above their weight. clearly, there must be some factor(s) besides the structural causes that you gave.

i'll give you a hint, and this is probably where you should have started your research: what is the validity of iq as a measurement of intelligence? what are the factors influencing iq, and can we say whether or not iq can be genetically inherited? what exactly does iq predict in terms of real world outcomes- does it predict success in school? in the workplace?

i'd recommend you actually dig through the available scientific literature on the subject- fortunately, it's quite extensive, and there are clear conclusions that can be made (while other conclusions have insufficient support to be answered either in the affirmative or the negative).

for all of your considerable skill in breaking down a complex argument, it's a shame that you get lost in the weeds simply because you don't have a map. then again, maybe you don't really *want* to know what the terrain is because you'd be radically unprepared to face reality. i hope that isn't the case"

"6245","watched the whole video and yeah i get this is like over a year and a half old but ...................
so i've spent a good portion of time re writing this comment.  only to find that fundamentally i agree with you. most of that rewriting came before an organization of thoughts. instead i now would say that i agree. i'm posting this here because i think it's a more important message to anyone who may read or see this. because you may spend your time  which in my case was about an hour, arguing against something you agree with.  in today's society we are led by pretty much every form of media, some sort of narrative. whether malicious or not. that is a super nondescript statement which is the point. see. i disagreed with you saying that pretty much anyone who's had any meaningful interactions with greater society has some subconscious racial biases. my argument being..... it would never cross my mind and that i think that with internet culture and the access of information to youth that it could in the future possibly yield nonbiased people due anonymity and due to the ability to rise to prevelance on a platform such as youtube regardless of race nationality, gender identity, sexuality, beliefs, or even income. i also argued that there could also be literal nazis from the same thing and the wide spectrum between.....but that really doesn't say anything about what the video said. as i said i really had to re think my argument to the current world and yes i think the way greater society is currently built we are given small messages constantly to think certain things of a race, whether intended/negative/ or not. such as, asians are better at taking sats..though as the video points out...i don't think i literally need to restate the whole video.

 so morale of the story anyone who reads this. think about things before blurting them out, because you never know you could be arguing something either completely irrelevant or even on the same side as the person you were arguing with. or in my case both, to which in my defense it's two in the morning. so i guess add that to the list probably not the smartest idea to make a response to a video when you're very tired."

"6250","another thing to keep in mind.

on average black americans do more violent crimes and murders than africans of all african countries except two; lesotho and south africa.

so, in order to find more violent and murderous black people than african-american, you have to go to the corner of africa where the segregation, oppression and general treatment were worse than in the us. african-americans do not primarily commit more violent crimes than european-americans because of genetics, it's evident that social issues has an effect on the statistics. developing countries are usually found to be more violent than developed nations, yet the us is an exception, and we have to ask why that is.

the whole ""blacks are genetically more likely to be violent criminals"" argument falls when you look at statistics in africa, and when you look at well integrated black people in progressive european countries.

you know i've debated a lot of alt-right people who push this ""blacks are more violent"" narrative, and when-ever i bring up the statistics showing this is mostly only true in countries where black people have experienced oppression, you know what happens? they shut up. not one single racist has managed to even say a single word back to that, so far.

another phenomenon is that freed american slaves who were sent to liberia are known to be more violent than the local liberians. oppression has an effect on people, and the effect doesn't magically go away after a couple of generations, it takes socio-political actions to mend the wrong.

the american phenomenon of black people committing more violent crimes and murders is not a case of genetics, it's evidently not when comparing america with other countries across the world. it becomes obvious that it's a case of social issues. so, in order to solve the problem, the only thing which would prove effective was to start with efforts on mending the wrongs, fighting institutional racism, integrating communities, and increasing efforts on education, welfare and jobs for black people. it might seem unfair if black americans were to start getting better treatment, but, no matter how unfair it might seem it's the right way to decrease violent crimes. which are often black-on-black crimes, so blacks are not only the perpetrators, often they are the victims as well."

thank you so much for opening my mind and harboring such cool people on your channel so that i can go check out their sweet content! of course now i have it ingrained into me that we all have our biases and goofs and that i shouldn't really look to even a single group or perspective to take off all the fabric on reality and finally see it for what it is. 

personally this has actually been quite difficult to my mental illness! one day i was called an incel and even after being quite insulted went on an incel forum and respected the person who called me that word even though they weren't very polite or understanding about telling me so.  that specific moment which made me feel i should have respect for that person was what opened me up initially, and i thank you again for posting these very entertaining and interesting videos which have helped me think more about these  statistic statements."

"6294","the point you make around 8:03 is a good one and i understand where you're coming from completely. however there are many many factors contributing to why black people are more likely to commit crime, and it's not just that there are more police encounters with them. on the south side of chicago, police rarely go there anymore because it's so dangerous. same thing in compton, ca. it's a mix of poverty, drug abuse, and recovery from years of oppression in the country. it's so many different things that it's hard to know where to start to fix it. thank you for making this video though, you're very intelligent and make awesome points!"
"6295","so what about statistics? poor idiots are probably going to breed poor idiots. if you grow up in a house where 10,000 words are regurgitated, you'll most likely be less intellegent than someone who grew up in a household that uses 100,000 words."
"6296","while i agree that you should be careful of unqualified statements because they can be hurtful, i do not agree with the condescending tone that is accompanied by the attitude that ""shaun"" displays. he is basically saying: you may not say thing like ""blacks commit more crimes"", because i know that there are many factors that contribute to this, but others are too dumb to know this! and so would come to the wrong conclusion.

this thinking is typical for someone who believes in censorship: somehow there is an elite (and i am one of them) that knows better and therefore can say what should and should not be said, because the dumb masses are not able to think critically (unlike me of course!).

growing up in sa in the 70's, pornography and nudity in films was not allowed. but as a teenager i knew there was some guy at the censorship board who was watching all the films and cutting out the parts we in the population were not allowed to see. i wondered why he was allowed to see things i (or anyone else) was not allowed to see! what qualified him as being ""incorruptible"", while we were not. nothing. of course, and that is my point!

political correctness and other forms of censorship is a way simply of saying ""i know better than you, so shut up because""! the libertarian, on the other hand, says let people make statements like ""blacks commit more crimes"", but allow all voices to be heard, and let people decide for themselves what the truth is. if the random ""joe"" who made this video is able to decide that there are many factors that lead to this, then why should not everyone else?"
"6297","william a. black points out that white collar crime (regardless of race, but) accounts for more financial losses than all other forms of property crime combined.

yet, i think it's functionally accurate that black males in particular, commit a significantly higher number of violent crimes, armed robbery, murders, etc. than do white males.  at least that is what statistical records show us for the number of solved violent crimes where race of the perpetrator is known.  we can think about the question of the degree to which black males with crappy attorneys and biased criminal justice systems are more likely to plead guilty to severe violent crimes they did not commit, but that is nearly impossible to determine.
we do know that violent crime rates are higher in certain heavily black regions -- which are associated with poverty -- including against black victims -- and this is unlikely to be due to white criminals invading the hood like ninjas to commit murder.
so, we can think about a number of other social factors that don't include any average genetic propensity towards impulsiveness.
-------------
i recently read an article by a black writer i think in the atlantic, who was suitably pro-black, but he wrote as an iconoclast on the mainstream brown vs board story.  one history site explained that naacp etc. included brown/kansas as the lead name above 4 other cases so it would not seem like a purely north vs south issue. 
this black writer pointed out that oliver brown did not want to be part of this controversial case and that the majority of black people in topeka ks were *opposed to sending their black children to white schools* with white teachers and white students.  they wanted what they already had, just a bit more money or less distance and easier travel, but they felt much more comfortable with black teachers caring for their black children and did not feel that their school was ""inferior"". 
in contrast, the other schools named in the case in washington dc and south carolina etc *did* have inferior conditions for black schools."
"6298","at minute 8:00 you say that a ""spiral"" occurs because the more crime that you ""discover"" due to more policing leads to more policing, which leads to the discovery of more crime. this is nonsense for 2 reasons: firstly, you cannot discover more crime than is actually there so this cannot be a never ending spiral. secondly, more policing must actually lead to less crime, not more. so the ""spiral"" should reverse itself, which means in your example there is actual pressure on the statistic to go the other way!

in actually fact, what you are really trying to do is blame the higher crime rate of blacks on systemic racism.

so, i here is an example that you cannot ""spin"" the way you want: ""the offending [homicide] rate for african americans was [from 1980 to 2008] almost 8 times higher than european americans"" (from wikipedia ""race and crime in the united states""). now since every murders to be investigated equally be police whether the perpetrator is black or white (!), is unlikely due to any police bias. the fact that the rate is 800% and not your theoretically 20% shows that there is also a real difference.

sure you can continue to cry ""lies, lies and statistics"" but while you do that the adults will be working on the real world problems that these statistic indicate."

is he a prick for thinking that, while two things can be horrible, he can still think one is more horrible than the other, and that this doesn't make the other thing any less horrible (the point he was trying to make), or because he picked an example that rubbed people the wrong way, which it ultimately did exactly because both things in his example were indeed horrible?"

"6336","""black people are more likely to be criminals than white people [in america]""

it's clear here that ""more likely"" is referring to a statistical circumstance. you then go on to completely dismiss the idea that genetics could be involved (because that's the domain of the ""kkk""), without actually examining whether or not genetics can play a role on human behavior, or influence any of a number of factors which increase the likelihood of someone committing a crime. i'm not going to make the argument that yes, blacks are *genetically* more predisposed to commit crimes, because causes of crime are quite complex (there are quite a few variables and you'd be a fool to assume that some congenital characteristic neatly explains the variance) and this isn't at all a good way to discuss whether there are some important differences between races as cohorts.

the sat is a much better example, but the sat isn't as free from cultural bias as the best iq tests, which is where i would really like to focus on. nevertheless, i think the sat scores are a good proxy as they are strongly correlated with iq. let's leave aside the comparison with blacks right now, and compare asian performance to *white* performance.

at this point in the video, i'd like to point out that it's a bit annoying you apparently didn't actually do any research, or at least, cite studies while you were making specific claims. one problem with this fly-by-the-wire approach is that your own cognitive biases are laid bare rather quickly: you automatically assume some sort of structural reason for success instead of even *entertaining* the notion that, eg, success in academics might have something to do with biology/genetics the way every other trait is.

for example, your construction of ""parental (academic achievement + financial means) = child's (academic achievement)"" doesn't quite fit the pattern of how asians historically integrated into american society. at one point, despite lacking formal academic achievement and financial success on the same scale that whites enjoyed, asians started punching above their weight. clearly, there must be some factor(s) besides the structural causes that you gave.

i'll give you a hint, and this is probably where you should have started your research: what is the validity of iq as a measurement of intelligence? what are the factors influencing iq, and can we say whether or not iq can be genetically inherited? what exactly does iq predict in terms of real world outcomes- does it predict success in school? in the workplace?

i'd recommend you actually dig through the available scientific literature on the subject- fortunately, it's quite extensive, and there are clear conclusions that can be made (while other conclusions have insufficient support to be answered either in the affirmative or the negative).

for all of your considerable skill in breaking down a complex argument, it's a shame that you get lost in the weeds simply because you don't have a map. then again, maybe you don't really *want* to know what the terrain is because you'd be radically unprepared to face reality. i hope that isn't the case"

so i've spent a good portion of time re writing this comment.  only to find that fundamentally i agree with you. most of that rewriting came before an organization of thoughts. instead i now would say that i agree. i'm posting this here because i think it's a more important message to anyone who may read or see this. because you may spend your time  which in my case was about an hour, arguing against something you agree with.  in today's society we are led by pretty much every form of media, some sort of narrative. whether malicious or not. that is a super nondescript statement which is the point. see. i disagreed with you saying that pretty much anyone who's had any meaningful interactions with greater society has some subconscious racial biases. my argument being..... it would never cross my mind and that i think that with internet culture and the access of information to youth that it could in the future possibly yield nonbiased people due anonymity and due to the ability to rise to prevelance on a platform such as youtube regardless of race nationality, gender identity, sexuality, beliefs, or even income. i also argued that there could also be literal nazis from the same thing and the wide spectrum between.....but that really doesn't say anything about what the video said. as i said i really had to re think my argument to the current world and yes i think the way greater society is currently built we are given small messages constantly to think certain things of a race, whether intended/negative/ or not. such as, asians are better at taking sats..though as the video points out...i don't think i literally need to restate the whole video.

 so morale of the story anyone who reads this. think about things before blurting them out, because you never know you could be arguing something either completely irrelevant or even on the same side as the person you were arguing with. or in my case both, to which in my defense it's two in the morning. so i guess add that to the list probably not the smartest idea to make a response to a video when you're very tired."

one of the most gut wrenching moments in speed is when bullock's character (kate?) hits a baby stroller and is mortified that she could have killed a baby to save herself and the other passengers. the relief in discovering the stroller didn't have a baby is a real & genuine catharsis. the chase scene in dh5 has no such respect for the civilians of russia."
"6353","8:00 just want to add to the taxi driver comments, one of the distinguishing characteristics of john mcclane in the previous 4 films and your generic action hero is his personableness & ability to be empathetic. yes he can drive certain people crazy, but he doesn't act like a jerk for the sake of it. he chats with the guy on the plane, he gets along with argyle, and he bonds quickly with the beat cop. (i'm trying not to call him carl winslow) mcclane is always equally charming, caring, and a pain in the butt, until the 5th film where he is a soulless jerk just because.

the russian thing is so badly used and i can't even say it has a weird xenophobic, 30 years too late cold war vibe because the movie is, as you said, nowhere deep enough for that kind of subtext. it's just ridiculous and terrible and stale

doesn't seem right."
"6440","the trick being played here is that they count just one instance of male+male, but you should count two, like this:
frog 1                         | frog 2
frog that croaked  | male
male                              | frog that croaked male
frog that croaked  | female
female                        | frog that croaked male
it's 50%
qed?"
"6441","it is 2/3. it's just a reinterpretation (and expansion) of the old game show logic riddle. the game show riddle has a set up of: there are three doors, behind one door there is a goat and the other two there is a cash prize. you get to pick one of the three doors, but before you open it the host stops you. he then reveals that one of the two unchosen doors (it's always a prize). you are given the chance to switch to the remaining unchosen door, do you switch? the answer is yes. the easiest way of explaining it is you are essentially getting to choose two doors, instead of one."
"6442","i think probability people trip themselves up a bit by focusing on putting everything in sets.

in this puzzle any non-croaking frog has a 50% chance of being either sex - and the choice is between one frog that's sitting next to a male frog, and one frog that isn't. we don't need to incorporate sets and probability equations. fifty fifty forever. 

what if one of em was sitting next to 3 confirmed male frogs? or 47? would that effect the probablility? no way. fifty fifty chance."
"6443","i am confused over the confusion. trying to figure out the likelihood of males croaking is not necessary information, you might as well they might croak once a day. all you need to know is that one of the pair is a male, and  ot knowing which one croaked and that you might lick either frog, possibilities of a male are:
f-m
m-m
m-f
if you lick both of the frogs, as given in the question, 2 out of 3 times you get a female, thus the 66.67% chance of curing the poison."
"6444","most of the confusion about this riddle comes from not understanding the distinction between mf and fm. 
if the first frog is f, the second must be m. however if the first is m, that tells us nothing about the second. that's how conditional logic works.

say you lick the first frog. there's actually a 66% chance that it's *male* given the possibilities:

ff (not possible)
fm
mf
mm

if you lick it and it's f, hooray! you're cured. the second frog is m, but who cares?
if you lick it and it's m, don't give up! you now have a 50% of being cured by the second frog.

to summarise: you have a 33% chance that the first frog is f. of the remaining 66%, you have a 50% of being cured.
so 33% + (50% x 66%) = 66%

the step most people are taking is to say ""well one of them is m so we can throw that out"". but how do you know which to throw out without licking it?"
"6445","i find logic puzzles like this fascinating, because they require so many unscientific premises to work. for example, the assumption that ""all male frogs croak"" is inductive logic; it is a projection based on incomplete data. just one croaking female frog would show that not all croaking jungle frogs are male, and if our only gender marker is that they croak, we risk relying on self-confirming logic that they are male because they have been labelled male. finally, there is of course the falseness of all the dichotomies throughout; male and female, the mathematical probabilities, are all artificialised abstractions. you could easily be living in the unlikely scenario. still interesting tho"
"6446","other people have probably got to this before me but here goes:

the reason that there's 3 options is because we're looking at each frog as an individual ie. frog 1 can either be male or female and so can frog 2, giving us 2 possible arrangements of frogs where they have different genders, one where frog 1 is female, and another where it's frog 2. as it says in the video we ignore the 2 females option because we heard a croak.

having said that: we're onto your main issue. where it seems like you may have gone wrong is that you applying assumed information that you do not have to the situation. that being ""why"" and ""how often"" male frogs croak. because the only thing that you know for certain is that the females don't; that's the only info you can work with.

you've only heard one croak, so you can't make any further assumptions. it may be that frogs croak once per day, in which case it is very unlikely that you'd hear a second croak in such a small population even if they were all males. so you can't factor it in.

does that make sense to you?"
"6447","basically your argument seems to be nature doesn't work like this so the set up is flawed. while i'm with you on that it *is* just a math problem so they typically should only be thought of with a mathematical lens. as for why m/f is different than f/m it's because you don't know which frog is the male so both possibilities are taken into account."
"6448","i know this is an old video, but you are right actually. it is the same odds to go either way. there's an unnecessary subset added to get the 2/3 fraction. since you are licking both frogs, there is no reason to not simplify (m,f) and (f,m) into one subset. therefore the probability is just 50%"
"6449","your problem is that you're nitpicking semantics and missing the point. the croak is a single information point that definitively classifies whether there is a male or not in the pair. the math, after making that assumption, is correct, and that's the point of the video. this is actually the same weirdness of probability that comes into play in the monty hall problem (worth a watch if you get the chance). my point is that the rate at which the frogs croak only comes into play mathematically if you imagine conducting the experiment over some time scale, rather than making an instantaneous decision about probability"
"6450","their position isn't fixed relative to the observer, so doesn't represent two discrete possible outcomes leaving a 50:50 chance. you get the same thing in chemistry when looking at probable molecular configurations depending on whether atoms are fixed spatially with respect to one another."
"6451","i, too, am mathematically inept. 

wow! feels good to finally get this out in the open and off my chest. at least i got some nice company."
"6452","my first thought... (not that i'm proud of it or anything)
2 frogs. 1 definitely male. chances 2 male frogs are just chillin' = eh.
chance at least one of these frogs is looking for some lovin' = do i really have to lick it?"
"6453","short reply: you are right that ted-ed is wrong, and encapsulated the issue pretty well. the math can get a bit hairy - along the lines of the tables you showed from other comments - but the truth is the we were not given enough information. but with the best guesses, you have the same chances with the pair as with the singe frog. but both are more than 50%.

longer reply, first about the 50% chance of having a male+female in the pair. it's easiest to explain with coins. suppose you flip a gold coin and a silver coin. it seems obvious that there is a 25% chance of two heads or two tails, a 25% chance that the gold coin is heads and the silver is tails, and a 25% chance that the gold coin is tails and the silver coin is heads. yet your intuition is telling you, incorrectly, that this changes if the silver coin is replaced with an identical gold coin. but probability doesn't care if you can tell the difference between the coins; they are different in some way, even if it is that one lands closer to the door than the other. so call one ""coin #1"" and the other ""coin #2"", and you get the right result.

what the puzzle didn't tell us, is how often a male frog croak. or if females croak, but the male is more distinctive. i'll assume they don't, but that was ambiguous. 

the error ted-ed made, is that a fact is not the same thing as an event. ""there is a male in the pair"" is a fact. ""the first frog to croak since you realized you needed to find a female"" is an event, and it can be the single frog even if there is a male in the pair.

if the single frog is male, there is a 33% chance that it would croak first if both in the pair are male, a 50% chance if one in the pair is male, and a 100% chance if both in the pair are female. these events that didn't happen increase the chances that the single frog is female to 9/14 (about 64%). and ironically, the chances that the silent frog in the pair is female are also 9/14."
"6454","fuck feminism! female frog is a mary sue!! sjws are ruining our riddles!!!!11!!!"
"6455","so i haven't been able to stop thinking about this horrible riddle since this video... infected me with the knowledge of it. i follow the idea that 'at least one of these frogs are male' only eliminates 1 of the 4 possibilities-that where they're both female, f/f-and this leaves three possibilities-m/m, m/f, and f/m-leaving you a 2 in 3 shot at survival. i get that, but here's the thought i keep having that makes me want to pick up a bat and start breaking shit:

what if we know which of the two frogs that croaked? let's say instead of knowing that 'at least one of these frogs are male', we know that 'frog #1 is male'? then of our four possibilities-m/m, m/f, f/m, and f/f-we have to discard both possibility three and four in which the first frog is not male, leaving us with a 50% chance of survival. naturally the inverse also applies if the croaker happens to be frog #2.

so following the logic of this, you only get the 67% chance of survival if you dont know which of the two frogs in particular happened to croak. as soon as you learn which one croaked, your chances drop back down to 50/50. so i guess if you ever find yourself in this scenario, you better avoid at all costs checking which of the two frogs croak or you'll immediately cut your chances.

what the fuck is this shit, schrodinger's frog?"
"6456","what parameters affect the frequency of croaking in the frogs might have had some bearing on actual frogs - but the mathematical principle about conditional probabilities is correct in the ted video. the whole story with the frogs is just there for illustrative purposes, but the problem is true for anything where you have some initial probabilities about the system but then you learn something, which shrinks the space of possibilities, shifting the probabilities for your system."
"6457","the real issue is they heard of the monty hall problem and thought they could be clever applying it somewhere else, but they seemed to of forgotten a key part of that problem. in the original problem you are presented with three options two result in a loss and one in a win. this in combination with monty opening one of the doors that's a loser allows switching to be better and the quirky solution of 67% to show up. the issue is the monty hall problem and the frog problem differ in that monty always has 1 win and 2 losses while these frogs can be 3m 0f, 2m 1f, or 1m 2f. the rest of their video is just them sloppily applying the monty hall proof to the frog problem which only makes sense as long as you don't think too much because the proof requires a 2m 1f assumption that does not exist. without that assumption each frog is truly an independent event and therefore each as a 50% chance of being male."
"6458","armchair mathematician/logician here. the video is incorrect in its analysis and here's why: when eliminating the set of female/female, you have to elminate one of the two male/female sets as well. thankfully, for simplicity's sake, both sets produce an identical result so we don't need to further complicate the problem (that said, we could go further if it mattered which was male or female). since it doesn't matter, we can collapes it into a single (fe)male/-(fe)male outcome (if you still don't understand why, consider: only one of the two sets is possible in any given iteration of this problem.) therefore we have the male/male and (fe)male/-(fe)male outcomes. considering both are equally likely, we are left with a 50% probability. not a 67%."
"6459","shaun, the phd guy is correct even if you take in to consideration the increased chance of croaking in the case of 2 male frogs since we don't know the frequency of male frogs croaking and we also don't have time to run tests. we were lucky we heard a croaking noise at all which diverted our attention to a pair of frogs, thus increasing our chance of survival from 50% to 66.67%."
"6460","the reason that the mf combo is listed twice (this is all prior to any of the croaking analysis) is that you are twice as likely to encounter an mf pair as you are an mm pair or an ff pair. in other words, if you randomly pick two frogs (under the assumption that m and f frogs are equally likely), you'll get an mm pair 25% of the time, an ff pair 25% of the time, and an mf pair 50% of the time. that is what the 1:1:2 mm:ff:mf proportion represents."
"6461","okay, so, after reading the comments, i think the issue is people applying probability retroactively.
so, some people replaced the metaphor of the frogs with flipping coins and using premonitions to know the outcome of one of the coins before you flip it, but, when you think about it, in both cases it's basically a really complicated way of calculating your probabilities using half of the actual, real-world data, and probabilities aren't supposed to be calculated using data from what *actually happened*.
like, i can approach this problem by saying ""what a coincidence that there aren't any f/f pairings!"", but the entire problem is designed to artificially limit the sample space so that there aren't any f/f pairings (which is racist against lesbians).
it's also kind of like xeno's paradox, when you think about it. i mean, we can move--we can travel distances--but according to xeno's paradox we can't. at the same time, we know that the probability of a frog being male or female is 50%, but apparently that probability changes depending on how many other frogs we consider at the same time, but that would mean the probability of this individual frog being male or female is simultaneously 50% and 67% and 75% (etc.) and we know that can't be true.

i guess what i'm getting at is applying probabilities retroactively destroys the fabric of reality."
"6462","i disagree that the mathematical answer of the riddle is wrong but i do have some beef with how it's presented. the scenario with the frogs does in fact give us additional information that alters the probability severely. male frogs croak to attract females and warn other male frogs from their territory. so when we hear one frog croak the double female option is removed from the sample space. when we see the other just chilling there and they're not fighting or anything the double male option goes as well. so the probability of finding a female frog in the clearing is 100% barring genetic defects or chemicals in the water that have turned the friggin frogs gay."
"6463","the problem i have with the riddle has nothing to do with math. you here a frog croak an turn around and see 2 frogs, these two events are not necessarily connected, you did not see the frog croak so you are jumping to conclusions, there could be another frog or 10 or 100 hiding behind a rock or tree.this is where this problem fall apart for me."
"6464","watching the video, it sounds like at some point they flipped the order of events.  for narrative purposes, they have you hear the croak, and that draws your attention to the clearing.  in the order of events they present, i believe you are correct: there are lots of potential clearings, and the more male frogs in the clearing, the more likely you are to see that particular clearing.  good catch!

however, later in the video, they act as though the order was the reverse: you see the two frogs in the clearing, then you are lucky enough to hear a croak come from the clearing. it is much easier in this case to act as though the croak is a lucky piece of information beamed directly into your brain, and come to the same conclusions as the ted-ed video.  it still doesn't feel perfect to me, but it feels much more intuitive."
"6465","just imagine if you flipped two coins at once. if i told you one coin is heads, how likely is it that the second coin is tails? 2/3.

the original sample base still matters even with the new information that you know one is heads.  it matters that they were flipped at the same time.

those who think this problem is wrong are thinking like if the coins were flipped one after the other; as if i flipped a coin and it came up heads and i asked how likely the next flip will land on tails.

we didn't turn our heads to see one frog and then see another frog jump in and ask what gender that new frog is.  we started with the sample base of 2 frogs, both having a 50/50 chance each, and those odds still carry over with the new information."
"6466","there are two ways to get one male and one female: either frog 1 is male and frog 2 is female or frog 1 is female and 2 is male.  you have to count them separately because it is like flipping two coins: you could get a head and a tail if you flip the 1st coin and get heads and get tails on the second one (50% chance x 50% chance =25% chance of that combo), or if you get tails on the first and heads on the second (also a 25% of that combo, for at total ""one heads, one tails"" probability of 50%)."
"6467","hey! i know this is two years late, but i think i've explained this in a logical way with as little maths as possible. let me know if it helps!

here's what they're doing in theory:

we check the first frog and it's male, then we check the second frog and it's 50/50 m or f. so far our options are mm or mf. if we check the first frog and it's female, then we know the second is male, which only gives one fm combination. so in total we have mm, mf and fm. but that leaves us with two win conditions and one possible fail... 66% one is female, right?

wrong. because we can't follow the same logic as the example with no croaking. in the no croaking example, we see two frogs that both have a 50/50 chance of being male/female. so the initial decision doesn't matter, we'll either pick frog a and get 50/50 m or f, or pick frog b and get 50/50 m or f. the overall spread are all equally likely m f m f. which just simplifies to 50/50 m or f regardless of which frog you choose.

however in the croak example, we know one frog is a male. our initial decision of which frog to test matters, because one frog is 100% male and the other is 50/50 male or female. so our spread for the initial choice is m & m f. then we take our second round for 100% m frog. his second round is the ambiguous frog, which is 50/50 m or f. so our options are mm and mf. now if we pick the 50/50 frog first, we know that the second frog needs to be the one that croaked, which is 100% m. so those options are mm and fm (even though we don't need to collect a second round of the first is f).

in this scenario, the final options are mm, mf, mm and fm. two of four options have one female frog.

fifty. percent."
"6468","sorry for the laziness, but i really didn't feel like reading down through the comments to see if anyone mentioned this as that would have deflated all the fun out of being a super smarty pants :)  shaun, the reason why the two m/f possibilities exist despite seeming to be the exact same scenario is explained in the ted-ed video itself when he explains that the probability of any one frog being male or female is independent of the probability of any other frog being either male or female.  i think (but could be wrong)  that this relates to one of my favourite probability mantras.  the dice don't remember!  really glad i gave your channel a second chance bee tee dubs (btw)!"
"6469","so this is just a shite version of monty hall??"
"6470","come on shaun, all of those mathematical riddles aren't too be taken literally. they're just using real life examples for abstract concepts and don't take into account any variables that aren't mentioned.
while your criticism would apply to the same situation in reality it doesn't apply to this riddle, since once again, like everything in mathematics it's only supposed to be solved using the given information and logic, but no outside information"
"6471","way too late to comment but the biologist guy didn't seem to understand the difference between permutations and combinations. you correctly don't see why male-->female is different from female-->male, because it doesn't matter in the first example. he is asking for different combinations (order doesn't matter) but then treats it like a permutation problem (counting order)"
"6472","there are two major problems i see with this riddle. 
1. the first answer being ""wrong"" explanation only seemingly makes sense if you don't know which frog is male. essentially it's permutation vs combination, and they're solving for a permutation when the combination is what really matters. you're right, there is no difference between. a situation in which the order would matter would be if you could only choose to lick one of the two frogs, in which case, you'd only have a 25% chance by going to the field rather than a 50% chance at the stump. that's what the riddle should have been. but since you're allowed to lick both frogs, that 25% goes back up to 50%.

2. every single calculation they used to apply to the 2nd frog in the field could also be used on the frog alone on the stump, in relation to the male:female possible combinations. there is no distinguishable difference. they're basically saying ""this frog is further away, so statistics no longer apply to it."""
"6473","female/male|male/female are counted as two separate options because in some mathematical problems the order of these would matter. but here it doesn't, these two options are identical. it doesn't matter which frog sits on the left for example and it's also irrelevant which one you lick first. 10th grade math for the win..."
"6474","the problem is flawed. you only hear the male croak, not actually observe a male croaking, which in the animation you can see that a croaking male's throat expands quite visibly. turning around and seeing two frogs in a clearing (out of cover where their camouflage is apparently ineffective, which means there could be an effectively endless amount of non-visible frogs) is no real indication that you've seen the frog that you heard croaking. going after the two frogs is still the best choice, as you've got two frogs of unknown gender to lick.

pedantry saves lives."
"6475","combining ''gut feelings'' with statistics is the sign of being a wanker."
"6476","my reasoning is that if the male has a distinctive croak that the female doesn't, it's probably a mating call with which it attracts females (as frogs usually do). if two frogs are sitting together and one is making mating calls, that probably means the other is not interested and thereby more likely to be male as well (i'll assume that it being a lesbian frog is highly unlikely, because unlike with social species that raise their children, homosexuality is not evolutionarily useful for frogs). so go for the one on the stump."
"6477","""i'm ignorant and i don't get why they're different, but they're different"" well there's the entire problem that you have with this riddle in one neat sentence! they are different because either frog could be the male in the case where one is male and the other female, so these are two distinct realities. one where leftie is male and rightie is female and the other where it's switched. these are clearly two different scenarios, if you rock up to leftie in the scenario where she is a female and assume she's a male, she might get angry. so there are two ways how there can be 1 male and 1 female frog. only 1 way how there can be 2 males. if you switch their sex in that situations, their still both male. nothing changed. no new reality. and voila, 2/3 or 67%. 

the issue you raise with the frequency of croaking is interesting though, that would be interesting to look into mathematically. of course if you know the frequency is very short in which they croak, then in the 2 frogs case you can  almost be certain that there must be 1 female, because you only heard one croak. but i think the riddle is set up in a way where you have to make a very quick decision so that your decision time compared to the croaking frequency is short and that you can't really infer that... not sure."
"6478","if it's mating season and the males will die if they don't find a female, then what would two males be doing wasting their time standing around together? the other one of the pair is obviously female, and the croaker is trying to get with her."
"6479","i'm groggy and having trouble following, but this reminds me of that stupid gameshow doors problem, and how your chances supposedly magically go up to two out of three when one of the empty doors is opened.

maybe that would be true if you were given the ability to open two of the doors yourself, but that's not what the situation is. it's actually a fakeout, of a 50% chance originally being disguised as a 33.333333333% chance. the gameshow people knew that door was empty, and they opened it for you before you were given the opportunity to choose any door. it was never a matter of thirds to begin with!"
"6480","i am no math wizard either, but i can explain why the male-female pair is counted twice.

it might be simpler to think of the frogs as a pair of values in a 2x1 matrix. let's say 0 is female and 1 is male (it's arbitrary which number represents which). you have the frogs sitting to the left and right of each other, so, if there is one male and one females they could be represented as follows:

 [0 1] (female on the left and male on the right) or [1 0] (male on the left and female on the right). 

both of these possibilities are instances with one male and one female, but they are not the same scenario. either one is a possibility, so we have to count both when we're enumerating probabilities. they could also both be male ([1 1]), but we've ruled out that they're both female ([0 0]).

i hope this clarifies. if there were 3 frogs instead, then we would know that *at least* one was male, but we still wouldn't know which one it was, so we'd have to count every permutation that includes at least one male, not just one of them. i think with three frogs it's a little easier to immediately see why we'd have to do that. 

if you know that at least one is male, then [1 0 0] (the male on the left), [0 1 0] (male in the center), and [0 0 1] (the male on the right) are all equally possible. of course, all of the possibilities where two or all three were male are also possible and must be counted as well, but they're irrelevant to this explanation. 

now, the one thing that i'm not sure about, and that i'd have to ask a mathematician, is why we don't have to distinguish the individuals of a given sex from each other when considering permutations. for instance, let's represent the males by mx (m for male followed by a number that distinguishes them from each other). going back to the example of two frogs, for simplicity, when we're talking about *all of the distinct possibilities,* why do we not distinguish between the following:

[m1 m2] [m2 m1]

obviously every combination of two females is removed from consideration for the same reason, but having male #1 on the left and male #2 on the right is not technically the same possibility as having male #2 on the left and male #1 on the right, so why don't both possibilities contribute to our calculation of probabilities? maybe some mathematician in the comment section can answer this. my only guess would be that, because we can't distinguish between individual male frogs, we only count all of the combinations of male+male once... but if there are two combinations that can be consider as that outcome, then doesn't it need to be weighted against outcomes which are unique? that's what i don't get."
"6481","here's the problem shaun: its an analogy for a purely mathematical statistical model. it's supposed to be taken completely at face value without any further analysis because it's merely teaching a simple mathematical concept. this happens all the time in early physics classes: you're given an absurdly simplified scenario in which you dont have to account for friction, drag, things like terminal velocity, and so on. you simply learn a formula like d=1/2gt^2, are told something falls from a height and to figure out how long it takes to fall. 

that's what this frog video is. it's an absurdly simplified situation to merely illustrate a mathematical concept. the moment you start to examine it it falls apart because it's intentionally removed from reality to illustrate the concept in its simplest form"
"6482","probably gone over already, thought i'd talk about it anyway:

first of all, as to why male/female and female/male are counted as two distinct possibilities: you have two frogs, and you don't know which one croaked. as such, you can't determine which of the frogs is male, only that one of them must be male. essentially, while it can be said that one of the two frogs must be male, it cannot be said that either of them is definitively male.

second of all, concerning the possibility of the male/male scenario being more likely: as is explained in the ted-ed video's section on conditional probability, the information we have available affects the probability of any given scenario being true or false, and at this point you're adding more information to the scenario. we have no means of determining whether or not each frog croaks at a consistent rate, what that rate would even be, whether or not these frogs croak at the same time, and so on. while these things may very well have an impact on the probability of any given scenario being more or less likely, they simply aren't known to us and, as such, aren't ideas that we can use to derive a probability of finding a female frog in the bunch.
to illustrate this faulty reasoning in another example: since we don't know anything about this frog's distinctive croak, it's entirely possible that males only croak when they're mating. if that's the case, then we could consider the probability of whether or not the pair of frogs contains a female frog to have some root in the prevalence of homosexuality in this species of frog. it may very well be the case that the probability of there being a female in the pair is greater than 75%."
"6483","oh no , game theory"
"6484","shut up and lick the frogs"
"6485","my issue with the riddle is also the croaking, but it's different than yours.  see, it would, logically, take some time and a lot of effort to discern a frog croak in the middle of the jungle.  i can't accept that it's easier to hear a croak, turn around, see 2 frogs, then try and identify whether the croak was male or female, than it is to just keep running towards to original lone frog.  so, the odds, are, at best,  50-50, but in reality you might as well just keep running towards the frog already in your sights."
"6486","i would like to say that i have been criticizing this riddle for years and i have been taught conditional probability by multiple teachers. i would like to tell you that you don't need to be any good at math to disprove this riddle. the reason this riddle makes no sense is because the person who designed it tried to use statistics to over-complicate things, and in the process of doing that he made a really stupid error. the person who created this riddle also was not a statistician and actually failed high school calculus"
"6487","mind your decisions made the same mistake though. he disproved the frog riddle while also making the same stupid mistake in the other riddle he talked about"
"6488","their video basicly justifies a gamblers fallacy. if you flip a coin once, it's a 50/50 chance to get tails. if you flip a coin twice and one of the results is heads, the second flip still has a 50/50 chance to come up tails. nothing has changed."
"6489","i hate this. it's late and i've been looking at the comments on this video for about an hour. was this your plan when you uploaded this video, shaun? was it??"
"6490","let me see if i can explain why the answer is 2/3 in a way that should be easy to understand and intuitive, but that won't just be parroting the same logic as others. so, the setup:
 we have two frogs. we know that one of them is male. this means that in all possible outcomes, one of the frogs is male. to find the probability that one of them is female we need to know 2 things: 
1) how many outcomes are possible if there is at least one male frog?
2) how many outcomes include one female, and one male?
we can divide the number of options from question 2 by the number of options from question 1, and that will give us the probability that we want. this is true because we are dividing the number of outcomes where we live by all possible outcomes. you can understand this by thinking of dice. the chance of rolling an even number is (3/6) because there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. we are doing the same thing, looking for (successes/possibilities.) 

so, question 1: how many outcomes are possible if there is at least one male frog?
 i saw a few people below me asking why we count mf twice, but mm only once. we cannot tell any frogs apart, but we can tell the frog on the right from the frog on the left. that's why there are 3: mm, mf, and fm. mm should not be counted twice because, to put it simply, we can't tell the outcome mm from the outcome mm. we can tell fm from mf, though, which is why it counts twice.

question 2 then: how many outcomes include one female and one male? 
this one is easy now, the answer is 2: mf and fm. 

so, our probability is (2/3)."
"6491","mathamatical theories are nice, but you could do and experiment. set up some fake frogs, male ,and female. radomized it. put malem female on the bottom. have person do the croaking. oh, that diagram, in reality, there would be the possibilty of being two femal frogs. do you see what i mean? radomly it could be: male,male. female male. and female female. just from writing this, if the female, male was okay, then the addition of the female female must be good too. right?"
"6492","{frog1=male,frog2=male} == {frog2=male, frog1=male} see the set (mathematics) article on wikipedia, the order of the sets does not matter
{frog1=male,frog2=female} != {frog1=female.frog2=male} these are not the same sets."
"6493","i think your reasoning is fine, but i think you're adding in a time dimension that the riddle is not supposed to include ;) 

i think the reason behind the 67% number versus 50% hinges on whether m/f and f/m are actually the same thing.
the logic seems to be that if you knew which frog was male, the odds would be 50% for the other one, but since you don't know, m/f and f/m are different outcomes, which gives you 67%. 

i don't agree with this logic... i think the riddle may be stated in a way that makes m/f and f/m the same, but it was supposed to keep that probability space open, but it just doesn't, narratively. 
narratively, one of these frogs has a 50% chance of being female, and the other is irrelevant, and we simply don't know which is which. it'd make more sense to say that, if you only had time to lick one of the frogs, you should go for the 50% instead of risking the 67% chance that you'd die because you chose between m/f and f/m wrongly."
"6494","the answer becomes obvious when you distinguish between the male that croaked and any other male. the real possibility space is;
cm - f

f - cm

"6495","i agree that the frog aspect of the riddle doesn't work as frogs are biological and free-agents but i have seen conditional probability explained using a more complicated 'find the lady' game. it is good maths, just poorly explained."
"6496","i don't see why position matters in this problem. you're licking both frogs, one definitely male (no matter where it was) and one which could be male or female  with a 50% chance for each.
moreover, why are we expected to assume that these are the only three frogs? the croak didn't necessarily come from the clearing, it simply came from ""the left"". if the croak came from an unseen frog, the probability of licking a female frog becomes 75%, because now position does matter, as we do not have information on either frog."
"6497","but ted-ed is satire"
"6498","wouldn't you have to factor in other frog behaviors too? maybe the males and females don't lime to spend much time together, decreasing the probability of the croakers companion being female"

"6500","every time i hear that organ music all i can see is naked terry jones playing the organ. god help me."
"6501","what most people don´t get is that male/female and female/male is different, that´s the crux of this riddle. usually, with no croaking ther would be a 50 percent chance that one frog is male and one frog is female, 25% chance both are male and 25% both are female. with the croaking, the 25% chance both are female is getting eliminated, leaving the 66/33 chance at the end.

(just the basic point of the original video, your point that there are different parameters in nature, that make those kind of logicpuzzlese generally inapplicable in nature is, of course, true)"
"6502","good point about the frequency of croaking. if they croak infrequently then  hearing a croak would be more likely if they are both males. if they croak frequently then the fact that you didn't hear two makes it likely the other one is a female. 

however, we are obviously not supposed to take that reasoning into account since we do not know that. 

i think the answer is wrong and i really don't understand why any complicated maths is required.  i think the mistake is that it is simply fallacious  to assume that the rules of a random set somehow magically apply to a single unknown frog, especially since we have a piece of information (one croaked) that makes it not a random set anymore.

it's like flipping a coin that lands heads 7 times in a row, trying to predict the next flip and reasoning ""it's much more likely for 8 flips to include at least one tails rather than all heads therefore the next flip is more likely to be tails."""
"6503","isn't it just a reskin of the monty hall problem though?"
"6504","okay, i know i'm late to this, and you've probably stopped caring, but math puzzles is kind of my thing, so i can't resist sharing.

first of all, the question of croaking frequency and how that affects your odds.  strictly speaking, you're not wrong to worry about this because that's exactly the kind of stupid little gotcha that these sorts of puzzle writers like to slip in.  you think to yourself, ""okay, he's telling me this little story to make it more engaging, but the information i'm meant to take from it is that at least one of these frogs is male.""  you form your answer based on that, and then in the solution, the author shouts ""gotcha!  you were supposed to infer that hearing a croak meant there was a greater than average chance of having two males because blah blah blah.""  so i don't fault you for getting hung up on that, but when it comes to understanding the solution... you kind of have to just take it as read that they were just coming up with a colorful way of telling you ""at least one of the two frogs is male"".

as for how they came up with the 2/3 probability, i'm just going to copy and paste what i put in hbomberguy's thread, hopefully it'll clear things up.

the intuitive problem is that you're told you have two frogs and at least one is male.  therefore, the other frog is either male or female.  50/50, right?

the problem is, we're treating these frogs as if they're indistinguishable.  let's give them names.  let's call them adrian and chris, to be reasonably androgynous.

there are four possible situations:

adrian is male and chris is male.
adrian is female and chris is male.
adrian is male and chris is female.
adrian is female and chris is female.

that's why we count female/male and male/female.  one situation is that adrian is female, the other is that chris is female.

all of these situations are equally likely until we're told that at least one of them must be male.  then we can rule out the last possibility, which leaves us with only 3 possible situations, 2 of which will save our life.  2/3.

the maths of probability are some of the stupidest i've ever worked with, and puzzles like this are designed to trip up your intuitive idea of what the possibilities are, so... yeah.  something to keep in mind if you like these sorts of puzzles, or to discard if you don't."
"6505","the reasons male female is counted twice is you dont know with frog is male. the sample space include all possible states for all frogs 

look up the monty paradox you'll like it."
"6506","the unstated assumption in the original riddle is that croaking is a rare event. if the frogs croak once every 10 years on average, then the original analysis holds. we would basically know that we've just witnessed a rare event and at least one of the frogs on the left is male. if the frogs croak 10 times a second on average, then we should go to the right. either we're witnessing an extremely rare stretch of silence for a male frog or that frog is female."

"6514","i think the original videos analysis is correct (having just come out of a conditional probability class :p), but even if it wasn't, it definitely wouldn't be 50/50. the island has to have finite frogs, so the fact that we can identify one as male increases the likelihood that the other is female by at least a margin. for instance, if the island had 100 frogs, 50 male, 50 female, and we knew 1 was male, then there would be 49 unknown male and 50 unknown females. that's kinda outside of the spirit of the thought experiment though :p"
"6515","the sequence of frogs does not matter. regardless of which frog made the distinct croaked all following scenarios still leave you with 2-1 frogs remaining which is still just 50/50 odds. this is a demonstration of a gambler's fallacy.

like so: female or male and left or right.
fl fr not possible
fl mr possible
ml mr possible
ml fr possible
this seems like the whole set but now we apply the fact that the croak had to come from one of them
fl fr as stated above it is not possible (0 outcomes)
fl mr croak can only be from right frog (1 outcome)
ml mr croak can be from either left or right frog (2 outcomes)
ml fr croak can only be from left frog (1 outcome)
so that's 2 outcomes with 2 males and two outcomes with 1 female.

it would be no different than arguing that you have a higher probability of flipping a coin to heads after a flip to tails. no previous proven result effects the outcome of any new results with the same probability.

just as an example try figuring out 3 frogs and 2 simultaneous croaks. regardless of the order of frogs you are still only left with one 50/50 frog in the end."
"6516","it does make sense:
you know at least one frog is male:
so there are three combinatiosn:
fm
mf
mm

fm and mf are independent solutions;

imagine you have a bag of equal numbers of red and blue coloured beads 
if you take one you always have a 50% chance of getting red or blue
if you put the bead back and repeat you still have a 50% chance, as the number of beads is equal still

so your first pull is:
50% red, 50% blue
and your second
50% red 50% blue

if you pull blue first then you can either get blue again or red
if you pull red first you can either get blue or red again
none of this probabities effect each other
there are four out comes:
blue then blue
blue then red
red then blue
red then red
each are equal in chance and so 25% chance each

now what we can say is ""if you know you have at least one blue, what is the chances that you have a red""
of the outcomes that contain a blue;
blue then blue 
blue then red
blue then blue
each has an equal chance to happen and so each is 1/3 chance

each pull is still independent, what changes the probability is the fact you know what the outcome is (at least one blue) and so any other outcome can be ignored. 


you are very much correct though; the issue with the riddle is the crock, as with two frogs that's twice the chance they crocked compared to just one male."
"6517","this riddle reminds me of this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1csftdxxuly"
"6518","i was thinking a about a different ""error"". say, you have a pop of 20. 10 female, 10 male. there is a 1/2 chance of picking a male, same for female. but if you pick a male, then the chances change. for the next pick you are slightly more likely to pick a female. which means for the riddle, that the male-male combination is less likely than a male-female or female-male. (but this depends on population size, but since you cant have infinite frogs, there will always be a slight decrease in the chance of getting male-male). a silly ""error"", but so is the one in your video :)"
"6519","dumb as fuck. it's just like saying: you have a frog of unknown sex in a box. there's a 50-50 chance that it's female. now you drop a frog you know is male in the box. you close the lid and jumble it around. you open it and voila, now there's a 2/3rd chance you have a female frog in the box."
"6520","to explain why m/f is a seperate possibility to f/m: imagine naming the frogs.  say we call one sarg and the other moly.  these are distinct individuals.  they each, independantly of one another, run the 50/50 chance.  so what you're asking is why isn't mr sarg and mrs moly the same possibility as mrs sarg and mr moly?  see, when you name the frogs, it makes clear the difference.  and it's exactly this kind of easily-done individual / condition mixup that a lot of gambling preys on.

try it out with a pair of coins.  flip them 100 times.  you'll get roughly 25% double heads, 25% double tails, 50% one of each.  that's because ""one of each"" covers two different possibilities.  they don't look different to you only because you can't tell the coins apart but if you could - say if one coin was red and the other was blue - you'd easily be able to tell them apart, but (and this is how it makes sense) changing the colour of the coins to help you distinguish them better doesn't actually affect the odds of getting one of each (or of anything else).

hope this helps clear that up for you!  :)"
"6521","you may actually have something here.  they've unintentionally introduced another factor into it, via the way they've gone about translating a dry maths puzzle into a fun frogs puzzle.  it doesn't actually affect the outcome whatsoever, so the video's still correct.  but it's a good thing to notice.  you should get into maths, maybe.  if you can apply a talent for picking holes in things, outside of the limits of metaphor imperfections, that's a great skill in maths."
"6522","there are 4 possibilities that have the same probability of occuring of  1/4 : either they are both males, both females, the left one is female and the right one male, or the left one male and the right one female ; hence the fact that the pair one male one female is counted twice. (that's overly simplifying the amazonian frog's sexual specter if i remember my jurassic park correctly...)

i agree with you on the fact that if both are male there is more chance that one of them will be croaking at that moment. when you take that into account, by saying for example that there is a probability p that a male frog does croak during a given amount of time and condition not only by the fact that one of them must be male but also by the fact that this male must croak, your chances with the clearing greatly depends on p. i won't detail the math here, but the closer p is to 1, the closer the probability is to 2/3, and when p is close to zero, your chances goes toward 50/50 (slightly superior, but at the limit you get 50/50). 

of course, i don't take into account here the fact that if both are males you might here multiple croaks and say that your mushroomed brain can only be sure to have heard at least one croak. i you don't make that simplification, you would have to make a far nastier modelisation (is it the same frog that croaked twice ? does the odds of that happening are big ?) with exponantial clocks and stuff like that, but it would still give you a probability bigger than 1/2, and even bigger than 2/3 in some cases (the fact that you only heard one croaked actually reduces the odds of both of them being males)."
"6523","if you aren't convinced by thinking about sample spaces, let's reframe the problem so that we're dealing with one random variable: n, the number of female frogs. this should sidestep the issue altogether.
n has this distribution (and draw yourself a tree diagram to convince yourself of this):
p(n = 0) = 1/4
p(n = 1) = 1/2
p(n = 2) = 1/4
we are told that n is less than 2, and then asked the probability n is greater than 0. clearly this is the same as asking p(n=1) *given that* n is 1 or 0, or in other words, what is the ratio of p(1 female) to p(1 female or 0 females).
you can calculate this as 1/2 / (1/4 + 1/2)  = 2/3"
"6524","can i just say to stay the hell away from maths....
it hurts my brain..."
"6525","he frogg"
"6526","their explanation can easily be confirmed to be correct by simply using a probability tree. in the case of the two frogs, you'd use a binary tree. the two distinct fm and mf pairs are important to be distinct, and you'll notice this is true with the probability tree you'll end up with no matter how many frogs you have. try it with a more difficult problem: 4 frogs. the likelihood of there being at least 1 female frog out of 4 is most definitely not 1/2, and the respective probability tree for that will prove it."

"6529","essentially the first answer is like that because if you have 2 frogs and at least one is male, then either 1) the frog on the left is the male you heard or 2) the frog on the right is the male you heard. you don't know which one croaked because you didn't see it. if you had seen it, then you'd know that the frog that croaked needed to be discounted, and you'd only have one frog to consider. but you're not considering one frog - you are asked if the pair contains a female!
if you had no audio cues, you'd be presented with this: frog on the left (l) and frog on the right (r). each individual frog has a 50/50 chance of being male (m) or female (f). so the possibilities for each frog are:
lf, lm and rf, rm. so each frog could be either. all the unique combinations are thus: lf + rf; lf + rm; lm + rf; lm +rm. like this, we see that there is a 75% chance that the pair contains a female: both frogs being female, left-frog being female (and right male), right-frog being female (and left male). despite the last two scenarios being one male and one female, they are distinct because they are describing two different frogs. each frog has it's own probability of being female, and thus must be considered separately. the 50/50 probability is associated with each individual frog, so ""l"" and ""r"" are different events so lf+rm=/=lm+rf, because l=/=r.
the remaining possibility is that both frogs are male, 25%. this works because we've been told that there's a 50/50 chance of a frog being female/male - so the chance of each combination is equal.
if we go back to your second point, adding the fact that we know that ff is impossible and that we heard one croak, then we consider the possibility of the following combinations again:
lf + rm(croaks)
lm(croaks) + lf
lm(croaks) + rm
lm + rm (croaks)
which, you'll note, means that if we went by the videos logic (which i'm not sure i'd agree with but i feel like that particular stats thing was maybe not how i was thinking it - i was working with sequences and the fact that lf has a 50% chance of occurring, which would mean a sequential rm after lf would be 100%, making lf + rm = 50% rather than 33.3% and lm+rf = 25% and lm + rm = 25% but that might be bollocks, hence it being 75% but for different reasons than they stated) that knowing something croaked makes the probability 67%, because each combination is equal, then you actually end up with 50%. the same odds. because with two males present, there's two outcomes for which croaked (and a small unconsidered likelihood that they both should have croaked, which would lower the odds of them both being male and make the odds of there being a female >50% like shaun said - the outcome of this being yeah, go for the two frogs). 
i mean i think the main problem with this is that the assumption of the croak raising the probability is... incorrect. is actually lowers the probability, because if there was no croak you'd be unable to rule out them both being female and having a 75% of survival."
"6530","i probably won't solve the discord that resulted on this mess on the commentary section, but, although is a 1 year old video by the time i'm writing this, i will give a try because this is getting on my nerves for no reason whatsoever.

the problem here is that both the ones claiming that the probability is 50% and the ones claiming it's ~67% are right, because they are analyzing different things.

the ones that say it's 50% they are not wrong in the fact that there being a male doesn't change the probability for the other frog. so if i know 1 of them is male the other one still has 50% chance of being female. the problem here is that we're not analizing each frog separately, we're analyzing the pair. the question proposed by the problem is ""what's the probability that exists at least one famale frog in the pair, knowing that one of them is male?"". now i will enter on the same calculations as the others(considering that the croaking doesn't affect the probabilities)

in the case of analysing the pair the answer of ~67% is correct. when looking at the pair, to try in avoid misunderstandings, let's analyse as both separates parts and then unite the pair.
there four possible combinations on the total that are:
mm=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
mf=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
fm=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
ff=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%

but, actually, for the pair i have 3 posibilities:
case 1: the pair of both males(or no females)
p2m=p0f=mm=25%
case 2:the pair with 1 male(or 1 female)
p1m=p1f=mf+fm=50%
case 3:the pair with no males(or 2 females)
p0m=p2f=ff=25%

knowing that i have at least 1 male in that pair excludes case 3 of the equation. so what is the probability of the pair being composed of opposite sexes?
case 2 is what i want and case 1+case 2 is the total. so the probability is what i want divided by the total, putting the values we have (50%/(25%+50%))~67%.
what this probability means is that if i lick both frogs i have 67% percent of licking a female on the process. if i pick one of them and lick then the chance of it being female would be lower actually as you already have 50% chance of getting de male one and 50% of getting the unknown one. the actual probability of me picking a female in this case would be (0.5*(2/3))~33%.

i hope this explain it."
"6531","""i don't even remember the order of operations.""

what the fuck is the order of operations."
"6532","i think i might have a lot of questions."
"6533","what's the order of operations?"
"6534","but are the frogs gayyyy?!"
"6535","i don't think you are wrong. the croaking complicates things."
"6536","the only major problem i see here is that you're supposed to assume the populations of female to male frogs is 1:1 when you don't actually know how many frogs they are male to female 

now the dilemma with the two frogs is correct in my eyes each frog can either be male or female so frog1 has a 1:1 chance the frog2 has a 1:1 chance but the frogs cannot possibly both be female causing a bull so you end up with the 3 answers frog 1 is male frog 2 is male m:m, frog 1 is male frog 2 is female f:m, frog 1 is female frog 2 is male m:f, f:m and m:f are different results because they are two individual frogs, so that means you have a 1:3 chance for situation 1, 2 and 3"
"6537","the actual answer is that male frogs croak to attract female frogs to mate. you ignore all the stupid fake math bullshit and instead use real world knowledge to come to a conclusion. you heard a croak, and turned to see two frogs. one of them is female, otherwise the male wouldn't have croaked."
"6538","both directions have equal chance because all frogs are independent of one another. so you have one frog to think about on each side"
"6539","if ted was right in their interpretation of the riddle, i could just carry around a male frog in the forest. whenever i encountered a random frog, i would place my male frog right next to it and - poof. there'd be a higher chance of the other one being female.
doesn't seem right."
"6540","the trick being played here is that they count just one instance of male+male, but you should count two, like this:
frog 1                         | frog 2
frog that croaked  | male
male                              | frog that croaked male
frog that croaked  | female
female                        | frog that croaked male
it's 50%
qed?"
"6541","it is 2/3. it's just a reinterpretation (and expansion) of the old game show logic riddle. the game show riddle has a set up of: there are three doors, behind one door there is a goat and the other two there is a cash prize. you get to pick one of the three doors, but before you open it the host stops you. he then reveals that one of the two unchosen doors (it's always a prize). you are given the chance to switch to the remaining unchosen door, do you switch? the answer is yes. the easiest way of explaining it is you are essentially getting to choose two doors, instead of one."
"6542","i think probability people trip themselves up a bit by focusing on putting everything in sets.

in this puzzle any non-croaking frog has a 50% chance of being either sex - and the choice is between one frog that's sitting next to a male frog, and one frog that isn't. we don't need to incorporate sets and probability equations. fifty fifty forever. 

what if one of em was sitting next to 3 confirmed male frogs? or 47? would that effect the probablility? no way. fifty fifty chance."
"6543","i am confused over the confusion. trying to figure out the likelihood of males croaking is not necessary information, you might as well they might croak once a day. all you need to know is that one of the pair is a male, and  ot knowing which one croaked and that you might lick either frog, possibilities of a male are:
f-m
m-m
m-f
if you lick both of the frogs, as given in the question, 2 out of 3 times you get a female, thus the 66.67% chance of curing the poison."
"6544","most of the confusion about this riddle comes from not understanding the distinction between mf and fm. 
if the first frog is f, the second must be m. however if the first is m, that tells us nothing about the second. that's how conditional logic works.

say you lick the first frog. there's actually a 66% chance that it's *male* given the possibilities:

ff (not possible)
fm
mf
mm

if you lick it and it's f, hooray! you're cured. the second frog is m, but who cares?
if you lick it and it's m, don't give up! you now have a 50% of being cured by the second frog.

to summarise: you have a 33% chance that the first frog is f. of the remaining 66%, you have a 50% of being cured.
so 33% + (50% x 66%) = 66%

the step most people are taking is to say ""well one of them is m so we can throw that out"". but how do you know which to throw out without licking it?"
"6545","i find logic puzzles like this fascinating, because they require so many unscientific premises to work. for example, the assumption that ""all male frogs croak"" is inductive logic; it is a projection based on incomplete data. just one croaking female frog would show that not all croaking jungle frogs are male, and if our only gender marker is that they croak, we risk relying on self-confirming logic that they are male because they have been labelled male. finally, there is of course the falseness of all the dichotomies throughout; male and female, the mathematical probabilities, are all artificialised abstractions. you could easily be living in the unlikely scenario. still interesting tho"
"6546","other people have probably got to this before me but here goes:

the reason that there's 3 options is because we're looking at each frog as an individual ie. frog 1 can either be male or female and so can frog 2, giving us 2 possible arrangements of frogs where they have different genders, one where frog 1 is female, and another where it's frog 2. as it says in the video we ignore the 2 females option because we heard a croak.

having said that: we're onto your main issue. where it seems like you may have gone wrong is that you applying assumed information that you do not have to the situation. that being ""why"" and ""how often"" male frogs croak. because the only thing that you know for certain is that the females don't; that's the only info you can work with.

you've only heard one croak, so you can't make any further assumptions. it may be that frogs croak once per day, in which case it is very unlikely that you'd hear a second croak in such a small population even if they were all males. so you can't factor it in.

does that make sense to you?"
"6547","basically your argument seems to be nature doesn't work like this so the set up is flawed. while i'm with you on that it *is* just a math problem so they typically should only be thought of with a mathematical lens. as for why m/f is different than f/m it's because you don't know which frog is the male so both possibilities are taken into account."
"6548","i know this is an old video, but you are right actually. it is the same odds to go either way. there's an unnecessary subset added to get the 2/3 fraction. since you are licking both frogs, there is no reason to not simplify (m,f) and (f,m) into one subset. therefore the probability is just 50%"
"6549","your problem is that you're nitpicking semantics and missing the point. the croak is a single information point that definitively classifies whether there is a male or not in the pair. the math, after making that assumption, is correct, and that's the point of the video. this is actually the same weirdness of probability that comes into play in the monty hall problem (worth a watch if you get the chance). my point is that the rate at which the frogs croak only comes into play mathematically if you imagine conducting the experiment over some time scale, rather than making an instantaneous decision about probability"
"6550","their position isn't fixed relative to the observer, so doesn't represent two discrete possible outcomes leaving a 50:50 chance. you get the same thing in chemistry when looking at probable molecular configurations depending on whether atoms are fixed spatially with respect to one another."
"6551","i, too, am mathematically inept. 

wow! feels good to finally get this out in the open and off my chest. at least i got some nice company."
"6552","my first thought... (not that i'm proud of it or anything)
2 frogs. 1 definitely male. chances 2 male frogs are just chillin' = eh.
chance at least one of these frogs is looking for some lovin' = do i really have to lick it?"
"6553","short reply: you are right that ted-ed is wrong, and encapsulated the issue pretty well. the math can get a bit hairy - along the lines of the tables you showed from other comments - but the truth is the we were not given enough information. but with the best guesses, you have the same chances with the pair as with the singe frog. but both are more than 50%.

longer reply, first about the 50% chance of having a male+female in the pair. it's easiest to explain with coins. suppose you flip a gold coin and a silver coin. it seems obvious that there is a 25% chance of two heads or two tails, a 25% chance that the gold coin is heads and the silver is tails, and a 25% chance that the gold coin is tails and the silver coin is heads. yet your intuition is telling you, incorrectly, that this changes if the silver coin is replaced with an identical gold coin. but probability doesn't care if you can tell the difference between the coins; they are different in some way, even if it is that one lands closer to the door than the other. so call one ""coin #1"" and the other ""coin #2"", and you get the right result.

what the puzzle didn't tell us, is how often a male frog croak. or if females croak, but the male is more distinctive. i'll assume they don't, but that was ambiguous. 

the error ted-ed made, is that a fact is not the same thing as an event. ""there is a male in the pair"" is a fact. ""the first frog to croak since you realized you needed to find a female"" is an event, and it can be the single frog even if there is a male in the pair.

if the single frog is male, there is a 33% chance that it would croak first if both in the pair are male, a 50% chance if one in the pair is male, and a 100% chance if both in the pair are female. these events that didn't happen increase the chances that the single frog is female to 9/14 (about 64%). and ironically, the chances that the silent frog in the pair is female are also 9/14."
"6554","fuck feminism! female frog is a mary sue!! sjws are ruining our riddles!!!!11!!!"
"6555","so i haven't been able to stop thinking about this horrible riddle since this video... infected me with the knowledge of it. i follow the idea that 'at least one of these frogs are male' only eliminates 1 of the 4 possibilities-that where they're both female, f/f-and this leaves three possibilities-m/m, m/f, and f/m-leaving you a 2 in 3 shot at survival. i get that, but here's the thought i keep having that makes me want to pick up a bat and start breaking shit:

what if we know which of the two frogs that croaked? let's say instead of knowing that 'at least one of these frogs are male', we know that 'frog #1 is male'? then of our four possibilities-m/m, m/f, f/m, and f/f-we have to discard both possibility three and four in which the first frog is not male, leaving us with a 50% chance of survival. naturally the inverse also applies if the croaker happens to be frog #2.

so following the logic of this, you only get the 67% chance of survival if you dont know which of the two frogs in particular happened to croak. as soon as you learn which one croaked, your chances drop back down to 50/50. so i guess if you ever find yourself in this scenario, you better avoid at all costs checking which of the two frogs croak or you'll immediately cut your chances.

what the fuck is this shit, schrodinger's frog?"
"6556","what parameters affect the frequency of croaking in the frogs might have had some bearing on actual frogs - but the mathematical principle about conditional probabilities is correct in the ted video. the whole story with the frogs is just there for illustrative purposes, but the problem is true for anything where you have some initial probabilities about the system but then you learn something, which shrinks the space of possibilities, shifting the probabilities for your system."
"6557","the real issue is they heard of the monty hall problem and thought they could be clever applying it somewhere else, but they seemed to of forgotten a key part of that problem. in the original problem you are presented with three options two result in a loss and one in a win. this in combination with monty opening one of the doors that's a loser allows switching to be better and the quirky solution of 67% to show up. the issue is the monty hall problem and the frog problem differ in that monty always has 1 win and 2 losses while these frogs can be 3m 0f, 2m 1f, or 1m 2f. the rest of their video is just them sloppily applying the monty hall proof to the frog problem which only makes sense as long as you don't think too much because the proof requires a 2m 1f assumption that does not exist. without that assumption each frog is truly an independent event and therefore each as a 50% chance of being male."
"6558","armchair mathematician/logician here. the video is incorrect in its analysis and here's why: when eliminating the set of female/female, you have to elminate one of the two male/female sets as well. thankfully, for simplicity's sake, both sets produce an identical result so we don't need to further complicate the problem (that said, we could go further if it mattered which was male or female). since it doesn't matter, we can collapes it into a single (fe)male/-(fe)male outcome (if you still don't understand why, consider: only one of the two sets is possible in any given iteration of this problem.) therefore we have the male/male and (fe)male/-(fe)male outcomes. considering both are equally likely, we are left with a 50% probability. not a 67%."
"6559","shaun, the phd guy is correct even if you take in to consideration the increased chance of croaking in the case of 2 male frogs since we don't know the frequency of male frogs croaking and we also don't have time to run tests. we were lucky we heard a croaking noise at all which diverted our attention to a pair of frogs, thus increasing our chance of survival from 50% to 66.67%."
"6560","the reason that the mf combo is listed twice (this is all prior to any of the croaking analysis) is that you are twice as likely to encounter an mf pair as you are an mm pair or an ff pair. in other words, if you randomly pick two frogs (under the assumption that m and f frogs are equally likely), you'll get an mm pair 25% of the time, an ff pair 25% of the time, and an mf pair 50% of the time. that is what the 1:1:2 mm:ff:mf proportion represents."
"6561","okay, so, after reading the comments, i think the issue is people applying probability retroactively.
so, some people replaced the metaphor of the frogs with flipping coins and using premonitions to know the outcome of one of the coins before you flip it, but, when you think about it, in both cases it's basically a really complicated way of calculating your probabilities using half of the actual, real-world data, and probabilities aren't supposed to be calculated using data from what *actually happened*.
like, i can approach this problem by saying ""what a coincidence that there aren't any f/f pairings!"", but the entire problem is designed to artificially limit the sample space so that there aren't any f/f pairings (which is racist against lesbians).
it's also kind of like xeno's paradox, when you think about it. i mean, we can move--we can travel distances--but according to xeno's paradox we can't. at the same time, we know that the probability of a frog being male or female is 50%, but apparently that probability changes depending on how many other frogs we consider at the same time, but that would mean the probability of this individual frog being male or female is simultaneously 50% and 67% and 75% (etc.) and we know that can't be true.

i guess what i'm getting at is applying probabilities retroactively destroys the fabric of reality."
"6562","i disagree that the mathematical answer of the riddle is wrong but i do have some beef with how it's presented. the scenario with the frogs does in fact give us additional information that alters the probability severely. male frogs croak to attract females and warn other male frogs from their territory. so when we hear one frog croak the double female option is removed from the sample space. when we see the other just chilling there and they're not fighting or anything the double male option goes as well. so the probability of finding a female frog in the clearing is 100% barring genetic defects or chemicals in the water that have turned the friggin frogs gay."
"6563","the problem i have with the riddle has nothing to do with math. you here a frog croak an turn around and see 2 frogs, these two events are not necessarily connected, you did not see the frog croak so you are jumping to conclusions, there could be another frog or 10 or 100 hiding behind a rock or tree.this is where this problem fall apart for me."
"6564","watching the video, it sounds like at some point they flipped the order of events.  for narrative purposes, they have you hear the croak, and that draws your attention to the clearing.  in the order of events they present, i believe you are correct: there are lots of potential clearings, and the more male frogs in the clearing, the more likely you are to see that particular clearing.  good catch!

however, later in the video, they act as though the order was the reverse: you see the two frogs in the clearing, then you are lucky enough to hear a croak come from the clearing. it is much easier in this case to act as though the croak is a lucky piece of information beamed directly into your brain, and come to the same conclusions as the ted-ed video.  it still doesn't feel perfect to me, but it feels much more intuitive."
"6565","just imagine if you flipped two coins at once. if i told you one coin is heads, how likely is it that the second coin is tails? 2/3.

the original sample base still matters even with the new information that you know one is heads.  it matters that they were flipped at the same time.

those who think this problem is wrong are thinking like if the coins were flipped one after the other; as if i flipped a coin and it came up heads and i asked how likely the next flip will land on tails.

we didn't turn our heads to see one frog and then see another frog jump in and ask what gender that new frog is.  we started with the sample base of 2 frogs, both having a 50/50 chance each, and those odds still carry over with the new information."
"6566","there are two ways to get one male and one female: either frog 1 is male and frog 2 is female or frog 1 is female and 2 is male.  you have to count them separately because it is like flipping two coins: you could get a head and a tail if you flip the 1st coin and get heads and get tails on the second one (50% chance x 50% chance =25% chance of that combo), or if you get tails on the first and heads on the second (also a 25% of that combo, for at total ""one heads, one tails"" probability of 50%)."
"6567","hey! i know this is two years late, but i think i've explained this in a logical way with as little maths as possible. let me know if it helps!

here's what they're doing in theory:

we check the first frog and it's male, then we check the second frog and it's 50/50 m or f. so far our options are mm or mf. if we check the first frog and it's female, then we know the second is male, which only gives one fm combination. so in total we have mm, mf and fm. but that leaves us with two win conditions and one possible fail... 66% one is female, right?

wrong. because we can't follow the same logic as the example with no croaking. in the no croaking example, we see two frogs that both have a 50/50 chance of being male/female. so the initial decision doesn't matter, we'll either pick frog a and get 50/50 m or f, or pick frog b and get 50/50 m or f. the overall spread are all equally likely m f m f. which just simplifies to 50/50 m or f regardless of which frog you choose.

however in the croak example, we know one frog is a male. our initial decision of which frog to test matters, because one frog is 100% male and the other is 50/50 male or female. so our spread for the initial choice is m & m f. then we take our second round for 100% m frog. his second round is the ambiguous frog, which is 50/50 m or f. so our options are mm and mf. now if we pick the 50/50 frog first, we know that the second frog needs to be the one that croaked, which is 100% m. so those options are mm and fm (even though we don't need to collect a second round of the first is f).

in this scenario, the final options are mm, mf, mm and fm. two of four options have one female frog.

fifty. percent."
"6568","sorry for the laziness, but i really didn't feel like reading down through the comments to see if anyone mentioned this as that would have deflated all the fun out of being a super smarty pants :)  shaun, the reason why the two m/f possibilities exist despite seeming to be the exact same scenario is explained in the ted-ed video itself when he explains that the probability of any one frog being male or female is independent of the probability of any other frog being either male or female.  i think (but could be wrong)  that this relates to one of my favourite probability mantras.  the dice don't remember!  really glad i gave your channel a second chance bee tee dubs (btw)!"
"6569","so this is just a shite version of monty hall??"
"6570","come on shaun, all of those mathematical riddles aren't too be taken literally. they're just using real life examples for abstract concepts and don't take into account any variables that aren't mentioned.
while your criticism would apply to the same situation in reality it doesn't apply to this riddle, since once again, like everything in mathematics it's only supposed to be solved using the given information and logic, but no outside information"
"6571","way too late to comment but the biologist guy didn't seem to understand the difference between permutations and combinations. you correctly don't see why male-->female is different from female-->male, because it doesn't matter in the first example. he is asking for different combinations (order doesn't matter) but then treats it like a permutation problem (counting order)"
"6572","there are two major problems i see with this riddle. 
1. the first answer being ""wrong"" explanation only seemingly makes sense if you don't know which frog is male. essentially it's permutation vs combination, and they're solving for a permutation when the combination is what really matters. you're right, there is no difference between. a situation in which the order would matter would be if you could only choose to lick one of the two frogs, in which case, you'd only have a 25% chance by going to the field rather than a 50% chance at the stump. that's what the riddle should have been. but since you're allowed to lick both frogs, that 25% goes back up to 50%.

2. every single calculation they used to apply to the 2nd frog in the field could also be used on the frog alone on the stump, in relation to the male:female possible combinations. there is no distinguishable difference. they're basically saying ""this frog is further away, so statistics no longer apply to it."""
"6573","female/male|male/female are counted as two separate options because in some mathematical problems the order of these would matter. but here it doesn't, these two options are identical. it doesn't matter which frog sits on the left for example and it's also irrelevant which one you lick first. 10th grade math for the win..."
"6574","the problem is flawed. you only hear the male croak, not actually observe a male croaking, which in the animation you can see that a croaking male's throat expands quite visibly. turning around and seeing two frogs in a clearing (out of cover where their camouflage is apparently ineffective, which means there could be an effectively endless amount of non-visible frogs) is no real indication that you've seen the frog that you heard croaking. going after the two frogs is still the best choice, as you've got two frogs of unknown gender to lick.

pedantry saves lives."
"6575","combining ''gut feelings'' with statistics is the sign of being a wanker."
"6576","my reasoning is that if the male has a distinctive croak that the female doesn't, it's probably a mating call with which it attracts females (as frogs usually do). if two frogs are sitting together and one is making mating calls, that probably means the other is not interested and thereby more likely to be male as well (i'll assume that it being a lesbian frog is highly unlikely, because unlike with social species that raise their children, homosexuality is not evolutionarily useful for frogs). so go for the one on the stump."
"6577","""i'm ignorant and i don't get why they're different, but they're different"" well there's the entire problem that you have with this riddle in one neat sentence! they are different because either frog could be the male in the case where one is male and the other female, so these are two distinct realities. one where leftie is male and rightie is female and the other where it's switched. these are clearly two different scenarios, if you rock up to leftie in the scenario where she is a female and assume she's a male, she might get angry. so there are two ways how there can be 1 male and 1 female frog. only 1 way how there can be 2 males. if you switch their sex in that situations, their still both male. nothing changed. no new reality. and voila, 2/3 or 67%. 

the issue you raise with the frequency of croaking is interesting though, that would be interesting to look into mathematically. of course if you know the frequency is very short in which they croak, then in the 2 frogs case you can  almost be certain that there must be 1 female, because you only heard one croak. but i think the riddle is set up in a way where you have to make a very quick decision so that your decision time compared to the croaking frequency is short and that you can't really infer that... not sure."
"6578","if it's mating season and the males will die if they don't find a female, then what would two males be doing wasting their time standing around together? the other one of the pair is obviously female, and the croaker is trying to get with her."
"6579","i'm groggy and having trouble following, but this reminds me of that stupid gameshow doors problem, and how your chances supposedly magically go up to two out of three when one of the empty doors is opened.

maybe that would be true if you were given the ability to open two of the doors yourself, but that's not what the situation is. it's actually a fakeout, of a 50% chance originally being disguised as a 33.333333333% chance. the gameshow people knew that door was empty, and they opened it for you before you were given the opportunity to choose any door. it was never a matter of thirds to begin with!"
"6580","i am no math wizard either, but i can explain why the male-female pair is counted twice.

it might be simpler to think of the frogs as a pair of values in a 2x1 matrix. let's say 0 is female and 1 is male (it's arbitrary which number represents which). you have the frogs sitting to the left and right of each other, so, if there is one male and one females they could be represented as follows:

 [0 1] (female on the left and male on the right) or [1 0] (male on the left and female on the right). 

both of these possibilities are instances with one male and one female, but they are not the same scenario. either one is a possibility, so we have to count both when we're enumerating probabilities. they could also both be male ([1 1]), but we've ruled out that they're both female ([0 0]).

i hope this clarifies. if there were 3 frogs instead, then we would know that *at least* one was male, but we still wouldn't know which one it was, so we'd have to count every permutation that includes at least one male, not just one of them. i think with three frogs it's a little easier to immediately see why we'd have to do that. 

if you know that at least one is male, then [1 0 0] (the male on the left), [0 1 0] (male in the center), and [0 0 1] (the male on the right) are all equally possible. of course, all of the possibilities where two or all three were male are also possible and must be counted as well, but they're irrelevant to this explanation. 

now, the one thing that i'm not sure about, and that i'd have to ask a mathematician, is why we don't have to distinguish the individuals of a given sex from each other when considering permutations. for instance, let's represent the males by mx (m for male followed by a number that distinguishes them from each other). going back to the example of two frogs, for simplicity, when we're talking about *all of the distinct possibilities,* why do we not distinguish between the following:

[m1 m2] [m2 m1]

obviously every combination of two females is removed from consideration for the same reason, but having male #1 on the left and male #2 on the right is not technically the same possibility as having male #2 on the left and male #1 on the right, so why don't both possibilities contribute to our calculation of probabilities? maybe some mathematician in the comment section can answer this. my only guess would be that, because we can't distinguish between individual male frogs, we only count all of the combinations of male+male once... but if there are two combinations that can be consider as that outcome, then doesn't it need to be weighted against outcomes which are unique? that's what i don't get."
"6581","here's the problem shaun: its an analogy for a purely mathematical statistical model. it's supposed to be taken completely at face value without any further analysis because it's merely teaching a simple mathematical concept. this happens all the time in early physics classes: you're given an absurdly simplified scenario in which you dont have to account for friction, drag, things like terminal velocity, and so on. you simply learn a formula like d=1/2gt^2, are told something falls from a height and to figure out how long it takes to fall. 

that's what this frog video is. it's an absurdly simplified situation to merely illustrate a mathematical concept. the moment you start to examine it it falls apart because it's intentionally removed from reality to illustrate the concept in its simplest form"
"6582","probably gone over already, thought i'd talk about it anyway:

first of all, as to why male/female and female/male are counted as two distinct possibilities: you have two frogs, and you don't know which one croaked. as such, you can't determine which of the frogs is male, only that one of them must be male. essentially, while it can be said that one of the two frogs must be male, it cannot be said that either of them is definitively male.

second of all, concerning the possibility of the male/male scenario being more likely: as is explained in the ted-ed video's section on conditional probability, the information we have available affects the probability of any given scenario being true or false, and at this point you're adding more information to the scenario. we have no means of determining whether or not each frog croaks at a consistent rate, what that rate would even be, whether or not these frogs croak at the same time, and so on. while these things may very well have an impact on the probability of any given scenario being more or less likely, they simply aren't known to us and, as such, aren't ideas that we can use to derive a probability of finding a female frog in the bunch.
to illustrate this faulty reasoning in another example: since we don't know anything about this frog's distinctive croak, it's entirely possible that males only croak when they're mating. if that's the case, then we could consider the probability of whether or not the pair of frogs contains a female frog to have some root in the prevalence of homosexuality in this species of frog. it may very well be the case that the probability of there being a female in the pair is greater than 75%."
"6583","oh no , game theory"
"6584","shut up and lick the frogs"
"6585","my issue with the riddle is also the croaking, but it's different than yours.  see, it would, logically, take some time and a lot of effort to discern a frog croak in the middle of the jungle.  i can't accept that it's easier to hear a croak, turn around, see 2 frogs, then try and identify whether the croak was male or female, than it is to just keep running towards to original lone frog.  so, the odds, are, at best,  50-50, but in reality you might as well just keep running towards the frog already in your sights."
"6586","i would like to say that i have been criticizing this riddle for years and i have been taught conditional probability by multiple teachers. i would like to tell you that you don't need to be any good at math to disprove this riddle. the reason this riddle makes no sense is because the person who designed it tried to use statistics to over-complicate things, and in the process of doing that he made a really stupid error. the person who created this riddle also was not a statistician and actually failed high school calculus"
"6587","mind your decisions made the same mistake though. he disproved the frog riddle while also making the same stupid mistake in the other riddle he talked about"
"6588","their video basicly justifies a gamblers fallacy. if you flip a coin once, it's a 50/50 chance to get tails. if you flip a coin twice and one of the results is heads, the second flip still has a 50/50 chance to come up tails. nothing has changed."
"6589","i hate this. it's late and i've been looking at the comments on this video for about an hour. was this your plan when you uploaded this video, shaun? was it??"
"6590","let me see if i can explain why the answer is 2/3 in a way that should be easy to understand and intuitive, but that won't just be parroting the same logic as others. so, the setup:
 we have two frogs. we know that one of them is male. this means that in all possible outcomes, one of the frogs is male. to find the probability that one of them is female we need to know 2 things: 
1) how many outcomes are possible if there is at least one male frog?
2) how many outcomes include one female, and one male?
we can divide the number of options from question 2 by the number of options from question 1, and that will give us the probability that we want. this is true because we are dividing the number of outcomes where we live by all possible outcomes. you can understand this by thinking of dice. the chance of rolling an even number is (3/6) because there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. we are doing the same thing, looking for (successes/possibilities.) 

so, question 1: how many outcomes are possible if there is at least one male frog?
 i saw a few people below me asking why we count mf twice, but mm only once. we cannot tell any frogs apart, but we can tell the frog on the right from the frog on the left. that's why there are 3: mm, mf, and fm. mm should not be counted twice because, to put it simply, we can't tell the outcome mm from the outcome mm. we can tell fm from mf, though, which is why it counts twice.

question 2 then: how many outcomes include one female and one male? 
this one is easy now, the answer is 2: mf and fm. 

so, our probability is (2/3)."
"6591","mathamatical theories are nice, but you could do and experiment. set up some fake frogs, male ,and female. radomized it. put malem female on the bottom. have person do the croaking. oh, that diagram, in reality, there would be the possibilty of being two femal frogs. do you see what i mean? radomly it could be: male,male. female male. and female female. just from writing this, if the female, male was okay, then the addition of the female female must be good too. right?"
"6592","{frog1=male,frog2=male} == {frog2=male, frog1=male} see the set (mathematics) article on wikipedia, the order of the sets does not matter
{frog1=male,frog2=female} != {frog1=female.frog2=male} these are not the same sets."
"6593","i think your reasoning is fine, but i think you're adding in a time dimension that the riddle is not supposed to include ;) 

i think the reason behind the 67% number versus 50% hinges on whether m/f and f/m are actually the same thing.
the logic seems to be that if you knew which frog was male, the odds would be 50% for the other one, but since you don't know, m/f and f/m are different outcomes, which gives you 67%. 

i don't agree with this logic... i think the riddle may be stated in a way that makes m/f and f/m the same, but it was supposed to keep that probability space open, but it just doesn't, narratively. 
narratively, one of these frogs has a 50% chance of being female, and the other is irrelevant, and we simply don't know which is which. it'd make more sense to say that, if you only had time to lick one of the frogs, you should go for the 50% instead of risking the 67% chance that you'd die because you chose between m/f and f/m wrongly."
"6594","the answer becomes obvious when you distinguish between the male that croaked and any other male. the real possibility space is;
cm - f
cm - m
f - cm
m - cm"
"6595","i agree that the frog aspect of the riddle doesn't work as frogs are biological and free-agents but i have seen conditional probability explained using a more complicated 'find the lady' game. it is good maths, just poorly explained."
"6596","i don't see why position matters in this problem. you're licking both frogs, one definitely male (no matter where it was) and one which could be male or female  with a 50% chance for each.
moreover, why are we expected to assume that these are the only three frogs? the croak didn't necessarily come from the clearing, it simply came from ""the left"". if the croak came from an unseen frog, the probability of licking a female frog becomes 75%, because now position does matter, as we do not have information on either frog."
"6597","but ted-ed is satire"
"6598","wouldn't you have to factor in other frog behaviors too? maybe the males and females don't lime to spend much time together, decreasing the probability of the croakers companion being female"
"6599","what if they both croaked at exactly the same time? they're both male and you're dead. i wouldn't go into a jungle without steel waders and a force field and a flame thrower. i lived in panama and i saw things there every day that would make your hair stand on end."
"6600","every time i hear that organ music all i can see is naked terry jones playing the organ. god help me."
"6601","what most people don´t get is that male/female and female/male is different, that´s the crux of this riddle. usually, with no croaking ther would be a 50 percent chance that one frog is male and one frog is female, 25% chance both are male and 25% both are female. with the croaking, the 25% chance both are female is getting eliminated, leaving the 66/33 chance at the end.

(just the basic point of the original video, your point that there are different parameters in nature, that make those kind of logicpuzzlese generally inapplicable in nature is, of course, true)"
"6602","good point about the frequency of croaking. if they croak infrequently then  hearing a croak would be more likely if they are both males. if they croak frequently then the fact that you didn't hear two makes it likely the other one is a female. 

however, we are obviously not supposed to take that reasoning into account since we do not know that. 

i think the answer is wrong and i really don't understand why any complicated maths is required.  i think the mistake is that it is simply fallacious  to assume that the rules of a random set somehow magically apply to a single unknown frog, especially since we have a piece of information (one croaked) that makes it not a random set anymore.

it's like flipping a coin that lands heads 7 times in a row, trying to predict the next flip and reasoning ""it's much more likely for 8 flips to include at least one tails rather than all heads therefore the next flip is more likely to be tails."""
"6603","isn't it just a reskin of the monty hall problem though?"
"6604","okay, i know i'm late to this, and you've probably stopped caring, but math puzzles is kind of my thing, so i can't resist sharing.

first of all, the question of croaking frequency and how that affects your odds.  strictly speaking, you're not wrong to worry about this because that's exactly the kind of stupid little gotcha that these sorts of puzzle writers like to slip in.  you think to yourself, ""okay, he's telling me this little story to make it more engaging, but the information i'm meant to take from it is that at least one of these frogs is male.""  you form your answer based on that, and then in the solution, the author shouts ""gotcha!  you were supposed to infer that hearing a croak meant there was a greater than average chance of having two males because blah blah blah.""  so i don't fault you for getting hung up on that, but when it comes to understanding the solution... you kind of have to just take it as read that they were just coming up with a colorful way of telling you ""at least one of the two frogs is male"".

as for how they came up with the 2/3 probability, i'm just going to copy and paste what i put in hbomberguy's thread, hopefully it'll clear things up.

the intuitive problem is that you're told you have two frogs and at least one is male.  therefore, the other frog is either male or female.  50/50, right?

the problem is, we're treating these frogs as if they're indistinguishable.  let's give them names.  let's call them adrian and chris, to be reasonably androgynous.

there are four possible situations:

adrian is male and chris is male.
adrian is female and chris is male.
adrian is male and chris is female.
adrian is female and chris is female.

that's why we count female/male and male/female.  one situation is that adrian is female, the other is that chris is female.

all of these situations are equally likely until we're told that at least one of them must be male.  then we can rule out the last possibility, which leaves us with only 3 possible situations, 2 of which will save our life.  2/3.

the maths of probability are some of the stupidest i've ever worked with, and puzzles like this are designed to trip up your intuitive idea of what the possibilities are, so... yeah.  something to keep in mind if you like these sorts of puzzles, or to discard if you don't."
"6605","the reasons male female is counted twice is you dont know with frog is male. the sample space include all possible states for all frogs 

look up the monty paradox you'll like it."
"6606","the unstated assumption in the original riddle is that croaking is a rare event. if the frogs croak once every 10 years on average, then the original analysis holds. we would basically know that we've just witnessed a rare event and at least one of the frogs on the left is male. if the frogs croak 10 times a second on average, then we should go to the right. either we're witnessing an extremely rare stretch of silence for a male frog or that frog is female."

also how would they know that mushroom is the particular mushroom cured by this particular frog? maybe they should have applied that knowledge, before eating the damn mushroom"
"6610","since frogs can change sex on an as-needed basis, the best course is to stomp on two of the frogs and the third will turn into a female. you have to be quick, though."

"6613","you don't remember the order of operations? i had to google it to find out what that means."
"6614","i think the original videos analysis is correct (having just come out of a conditional probability class :p), but even if it wasn't, it definitely wouldn't be 50/50. the island has to have finite frogs, so the fact that we can identify one as male increases the likelihood that the other is female by at least a margin. for instance, if the island had 100 frogs, 50 male, 50 female, and we knew 1 was male, then there would be 49 unknown male and 50 unknown females. that's kinda outside of the spirit of the thought experiment though :p"
"6615","the sequence of frogs does not matter. regardless of which frog made the distinct croaked all following scenarios still leave you with 2-1 frogs remaining which is still just 50/50 odds. this is a demonstration of a gambler's fallacy.

like so: female or male and left or right.
fl fr not possible
fl mr possible
ml mr possible
ml fr possible
this seems like the whole set but now we apply the fact that the croak had to come from one of them
fl fr as stated above it is not possible (0 outcomes)
fl mr croak can only be from right frog (1 outcome)
ml mr croak can be from either left or right frog (2 outcomes)
ml fr croak can only be from left frog (1 outcome)
so that's 2 outcomes with 2 males and two outcomes with 1 female.

it would be no different than arguing that you have a higher probability of flipping a coin to heads after a flip to tails. no previous proven result effects the outcome of any new results with the same probability.

just as an example try figuring out 3 frogs and 2 simultaneous croaks. regardless of the order of frogs you are still only left with one 50/50 frog in the end."
"6616","it does make sense:
you know at least one frog is male:
so there are three combinatiosn:
fm
mf
mm

fm and mf are independent solutions;

imagine you have a bag of equal numbers of red and blue coloured beads 
if you take one you always have a 50% chance of getting red or blue
if you put the bead back and repeat you still have a 50% chance, as the number of beads is equal still

so your first pull is:
50% red, 50% blue
and your second
50% red 50% blue

if you pull blue first then you can either get blue again or red
if you pull red first you can either get blue or red again
none of this probabities effect each other
there are four out comes:
blue then blue
blue then red
red then blue
red then red
each are equal in chance and so 25% chance each

now what we can say is ""if you know you have at least one blue, what is the chances that you have a red""
of the outcomes that contain a blue;
blue then blue 
blue then red
blue then blue
each has an equal chance to happen and so each is 1/3 chance

each pull is still independent, what changes the probability is the fact you know what the outcome is (at least one blue) and so any other outcome can be ignored. 


you are very much correct though; the issue with the riddle is the crock, as with two frogs that's twice the chance they crocked compared to just one male."
"6617","this riddle reminds me of this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1csftdxxuly"
"6618","i was thinking a about a different ""error"". say, you have a pop of 20. 10 female, 10 male. there is a 1/2 chance of picking a male, same for female. but if you pick a male, then the chances change. for the next pick you are slightly more likely to pick a female. which means for the riddle, that the male-male combination is less likely than a male-female or female-male. (but this depends on population size, but since you cant have infinite frogs, there will always be a slight decrease in the chance of getting male-male). a silly ""error"", but so is the one in your video :)"
"6619","dumb as fuck. it's just like saying: you have a frog of unknown sex in a box. there's a 50-50 chance that it's female. now you drop a frog you know is male in the box. you close the lid and jumble it around. you open it and voila, now there's a 2/3rd chance you have a female frog in the box."
"6620","to explain why m/f is a seperate possibility to f/m: imagine naming the frogs.  say we call one sarg and the other moly.  these are distinct individuals.  they each, independantly of one another, run the 50/50 chance.  so what you're asking is why isn't mr sarg and mrs moly the same possibility as mrs sarg and mr moly?  see, when you name the frogs, it makes clear the difference.  and it's exactly this kind of easily-done individual / condition mixup that a lot of gambling preys on.

try it out with a pair of coins.  flip them 100 times.  you'll get roughly 25% double heads, 25% double tails, 50% one of each.  that's because ""one of each"" covers two different possibilities.  they don't look different to you only because you can't tell the coins apart but if you could - say if one coin was red and the other was blue - you'd easily be able to tell them apart, but (and this is how it makes sense) changing the colour of the coins to help you distinguish them better doesn't actually affect the odds of getting one of each (or of anything else).

hope this helps clear that up for you!  :)"
"6621","you may actually have something here.  they've unintentionally introduced another factor into it, via the way they've gone about translating a dry maths puzzle into a fun frogs puzzle.  it doesn't actually affect the outcome whatsoever, so the video's still correct.  but it's a good thing to notice.  you should get into maths, maybe.  if you can apply a talent for picking holes in things, outside of the limits of metaphor imperfections, that's a great skill in maths."
"6622","there are 4 possibilities that have the same probability of occuring of  1/4 : either they are both males, both females, the left one is female and the right one male, or the left one male and the right one female ; hence the fact that the pair one male one female is counted twice. (that's overly simplifying the amazonian frog's sexual specter if i remember my jurassic park correctly...)

i agree with you on the fact that if both are male there is more chance that one of them will be croaking at that moment. when you take that into account, by saying for example that there is a probability p that a male frog does croak during a given amount of time and condition not only by the fact that one of them must be male but also by the fact that this male must croak, your chances with the clearing greatly depends on p. i won't detail the math here, but the closer p is to 1, the closer the probability is to 2/3, and when p is close to zero, your chances goes toward 50/50 (slightly superior, but at the limit you get 50/50). 

of course, i don't take into account here the fact that if both are males you might here multiple croaks and say that your mushroomed brain can only be sure to have heard at least one croak. i you don't make that simplification, you would have to make a far nastier modelisation (is it the same frog that croaked twice ? does the odds of that happening are big ?) with exponantial clocks and stuff like that, but it would still give you a probability bigger than 1/2, and even bigger than 2/3 in some cases (the fact that you only heard one croaked actually reduces the odds of both of them being males)."
"6623","if you aren't convinced by thinking about sample spaces, let's reframe the problem so that we're dealing with one random variable: n, the number of female frogs. this should sidestep the issue altogether.
n has this distribution (and draw yourself a tree diagram to convince yourself of this):
p(n = 0) = 1/4
p(n = 1) = 1/2
p(n = 2) = 1/4
we are told that n is less than 2, and then asked the probability n is greater than 0. clearly this is the same as asking p(n=1) *given that* n is 1 or 0, or in other words, what is the ratio of p(1 female) to p(1 female or 0 females).
you can calculate this as 1/2 / (1/4 + 1/2)  = 2/3"
"6624","can i just say to stay the hell away from maths....
it hurts my brain..."
"6625","he frogg"
"6626","their explanation can easily be confirmed to be correct by simply using a probability tree. in the case of the two frogs, you'd use a binary tree. the two distinct fm and mf pairs are important to be distinct, and you'll notice this is true with the probability tree you'll end up with no matter how many frogs you have. try it with a more difficult problem: 4 frogs. the likelihood of there being at least 1 female frog out of 4 is most definitely not 1/2, and the respective probability tree for that will prove it."
"6627","i keep fish and frogs. i currently have two male frogs and one female frog. actual solution: wait until dark, the males never shut up. ever."
"6628","logic beats mathematics on this one. in one direction you have a frog that have 50% percent chance of being female and in the other direction you have a frog that have another frog with 50% chance of being female with a male in the side. the male is useless in this riddle. i gess you dont even have to use probabilistics here."
"6629","essentially the first answer is like that because if you have 2 frogs and at least one is male, then either 1) the frog on the left is the male you heard or 2) the frog on the right is the male you heard. you don't know which one croaked because you didn't see it. if you had seen it, then you'd know that the frog that croaked needed to be discounted, and you'd only have one frog to consider. but you're not considering one frog - you are asked if the pair contains a female!
if you had no audio cues, you'd be presented with this: frog on the left (l) and frog on the right (r). each individual frog has a 50/50 chance of being male (m) or female (f). so the possibilities for each frog are:
lf, lm and rf, rm. so each frog could be either. all the unique combinations are thus: lf + rf; lf + rm; lm + rf; lm +rm. like this, we see that there is a 75% chance that the pair contains a female: both frogs being female, left-frog being female (and right male), right-frog being female (and left male). despite the last two scenarios being one male and one female, they are distinct because they are describing two different frogs. each frog has it's own probability of being female, and thus must be considered separately. the 50/50 probability is associated with each individual frog, so ""l"" and ""r"" are different events so lf+rm=/=lm+rf, because l=/=r.
the remaining possibility is that both frogs are male, 25%. this works because we've been told that there's a 50/50 chance of a frog being female/male - so the chance of each combination is equal.
if we go back to your second point, adding the fact that we know that ff is impossible and that we heard one croak, then we consider the possibility of the following combinations again:
lf + rm(croaks)
lm(croaks) + lf
lm(croaks) + rm
lm + rm (croaks)
which, you'll note, means that if we went by the videos logic (which i'm not sure i'd agree with but i feel like that particular stats thing was maybe not how i was thinking it - i was working with sequences and the fact that lf has a 50% chance of occurring, which would mean a sequential rm after lf would be 100%, making lf + rm = 50% rather than 33.3% and lm+rf = 25% and lm + rm = 25% but that might be bollocks, hence it being 75% but for different reasons than they stated) that knowing something croaked makes the probability 67%, because each combination is equal, then you actually end up with 50%. the same odds. because with two males present, there's two outcomes for which croaked (and a small unconsidered likelihood that they both should have croaked, which would lower the odds of them both being male and make the odds of there being a female >50% like shaun said - the outcome of this being yeah, go for the two frogs). 
i mean i think the main problem with this is that the assumption of the croak raising the probability is... incorrect. is actually lowers the probability, because if there was no croak you'd be unable to rule out them both being female and having a 75% of survival."
"6630","i probably won't solve the discord that resulted on this mess on the commentary section, but, although is a 1 year old video by the time i'm writing this, i will give a try because this is getting on my nerves for no reason whatsoever.

the problem here is that both the ones claiming that the probability is 50% and the ones claiming it's ~67% are right, because they are analyzing different things.

the ones that say it's 50% they are not wrong in the fact that there being a male doesn't change the probability for the other frog. so if i know 1 of them is male the other one still has 50% chance of being female. the problem here is that we're not analizing each frog separately, we're analyzing the pair. the question proposed by the problem is ""what's the probability that exists at least one famale frog in the pair, knowing that one of them is male?"". now i will enter on the same calculations as the others(considering that the croaking doesn't affect the probabilities)

in the case of analysing the pair the answer of ~67% is correct. when looking at the pair, to try in avoid misunderstandings, let's analyse as both separates parts and then unite the pair.
there four possible combinations on the total that are:
mm=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
mf=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
fm=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
ff=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%

but, actually, for the pair i have 3 posibilities:
case 1: the pair of both males(or no females)
p2m=p0f=mm=25%
case 2:the pair with 1 male(or 1 female)
p1m=p1f=mf+fm=50%
case 3:the pair with no males(or 2 females)
p0m=p2f=ff=25%

knowing that i have at least 1 male in that pair excludes case 3 of the equation. so what is the probability of the pair being composed of opposite sexes?
case 2 is what i want and case 1+case 2 is the total. so the probability is what i want divided by the total, putting the values we have (50%/(25%+50%))~67%.
what this probability means is that if i lick both frogs i have 67% percent of licking a female on the process. if i pick one of them and lick then the chance of it being female would be lower actually as you already have 50% chance of getting de male one and 50% of getting the unknown one. the actual probability of me picking a female in this case would be (0.5*(2/3))~33%.

i hope this explain it."
"6631","""i don't even remember the order of operations.""

what the fuck is the order of operations."
"6632","i think i might have a lot of questions."
"6633","what's the order of operations?"
"6634","but are the frogs gayyyy?!"
"6635","i don't think you are wrong. the croaking complicates things."
"6636","the only major problem i see here is that you're supposed to assume the populations of female to male frogs is 1:1 when you don't actually know how many frogs they are male to female 

now the dilemma with the two frogs is correct in my eyes each frog can either be male or female so frog1 has a 1:1 chance the frog2 has a 1:1 chance but the frogs cannot possibly both be female causing a bull so you end up with the 3 answers frog 1 is male frog 2 is male m:m, frog 1 is male frog 2 is female f:m, frog 1 is female frog 2 is male m:f, f:m and m:f are different results because they are two individual frogs, so that means you have a 1:3 chance for situation 1, 2 and 3"
"6637","the actual answer is that male frogs croak to attract female frogs to mate. you ignore all the stupid fake math bullshit and instead use real world knowledge to come to a conclusion. you heard a croak, and turned to see two frogs. one of them is female, otherwise the male wouldn't have croaked."
"6638","both directions have equal chance because all frogs are independent of one another. so you have one frog to think about on each side"
"6639","if ted was right in their interpretation of the riddle, i could just carry around a male frog in the forest. whenever i encountered a random frog, i would place my male frog right next to it and - poof. there'd be a higher chance of the other one being female.
doesn't seem right."
"6640","the trick being played here is that they count just one instance of male+male, but you should count two, like this:
frog 1                         | frog 2
frog that croaked  | male
male                              | frog that croaked male
frog that croaked  | female
female                        | frog that croaked male
it's 50%
qed?"
"6641","it is 2/3. it's just a reinterpretation (and expansion) of the old game show logic riddle. the game show riddle has a set up of: there are three doors, behind one door there is a goat and the other two there is a cash prize. you get to pick one of the three doors, but before you open it the host stops you. he then reveals that one of the two unchosen doors (it's always a prize). you are given the chance to switch to the remaining unchosen door, do you switch? the answer is yes. the easiest way of explaining it is you are essentially getting to choose two doors, instead of one."
"6642","i think probability people trip themselves up a bit by focusing on putting everything in sets.

in this puzzle any non-croaking frog has a 50% chance of being either sex - and the choice is between one frog that's sitting next to a male frog, and one frog that isn't. we don't need to incorporate sets and probability equations. fifty fifty forever. 

what if one of em was sitting next to 3 confirmed male frogs? or 47? would that effect the probablility? no way. fifty fifty chance."
"6643","i am confused over the confusion. trying to figure out the likelihood of males croaking is not necessary information, you might as well they might croak once a day. all you need to know is that one of the pair is a male, and  ot knowing which one croaked and that you might lick either frog, possibilities of a male are:
f-m
m-m
m-f
if you lick both of the frogs, as given in the question, 2 out of 3 times you get a female, thus the 66.67% chance of curing the poison."
"6644","most of the confusion about this riddle comes from not understanding the distinction between mf and fm. 
if the first frog is f, the second must be m. however if the first is m, that tells us nothing about the second. that's how conditional logic works.

say you lick the first frog. there's actually a 66% chance that it's *male* given the possibilities:

ff (not possible)
fm
mf
mm

if you lick it and it's f, hooray! you're cured. the second frog is m, but who cares?
if you lick it and it's m, don't give up! you now have a 50% of being cured by the second frog.

to summarise: you have a 33% chance that the first frog is f. of the remaining 66%, you have a 50% of being cured.
so 33% + (50% x 66%) = 66%

the step most people are taking is to say ""well one of them is m so we can throw that out"". but how do you know which to throw out without licking it?"
"6645","i find logic puzzles like this fascinating, because they require so many unscientific premises to work. for example, the assumption that ""all male frogs croak"" is inductive logic; it is a projection based on incomplete data. just one croaking female frog would show that not all croaking jungle frogs are male, and if our only gender marker is that they croak, we risk relying on self-confirming logic that they are male because they have been labelled male. finally, there is of course the falseness of all the dichotomies throughout; male and female, the mathematical probabilities, are all artificialised abstractions. you could easily be living in the unlikely scenario. still interesting tho"
"6646","other people have probably got to this before me but here goes:

the reason that there's 3 options is because we're looking at each frog as an individual ie. frog 1 can either be male or female and so can frog 2, giving us 2 possible arrangements of frogs where they have different genders, one where frog 1 is female, and another where it's frog 2. as it says in the video we ignore the 2 females option because we heard a croak.

having said that: we're onto your main issue. where it seems like you may have gone wrong is that you applying assumed information that you do not have to the situation. that being ""why"" and ""how often"" male frogs croak. because the only thing that you know for certain is that the females don't; that's the only info you can work with.

you've only heard one croak, so you can't make any further assumptions. it may be that frogs croak once per day, in which case it is very unlikely that you'd hear a second croak in such a small population even if they were all males. so you can't factor it in.

does that make sense to you?"
"6647","basically your argument seems to be nature doesn't work like this so the set up is flawed. while i'm with you on that it *is* just a math problem so they typically should only be thought of with a mathematical lens. as for why m/f is different than f/m it's because you don't know which frog is the male so both possibilities are taken into account."
"6648","i know this is an old video, but you are right actually. it is the same odds to go either way. there's an unnecessary subset added to get the 2/3 fraction. since you are licking both frogs, there is no reason to not simplify (m,f) and (f,m) into one subset. therefore the probability is just 50%"
"6649","your problem is that you're nitpicking semantics and missing the point. the croak is a single information point that definitively classifies whether there is a male or not in the pair. the math, after making that assumption, is correct, and that's the point of the video. this is actually the same weirdness of probability that comes into play in the monty hall problem (worth a watch if you get the chance). my point is that the rate at which the frogs croak only comes into play mathematically if you imagine conducting the experiment over some time scale, rather than making an instantaneous decision about probability"
"6650","their position isn't fixed relative to the observer, so doesn't represent two discrete possible outcomes leaving a 50:50 chance. you get the same thing in chemistry when looking at probable molecular configurations depending on whether atoms are fixed spatially with respect to one another."
"6651","i, too, am mathematically inept. 

wow! feels good to finally get this out in the open and off my chest. at least i got some nice company."
"6652","my first thought... (not that i'm proud of it or anything)
2 frogs. 1 definitely male. chances 2 male frogs are just chillin' = eh.
chance at least one of these frogs is looking for some lovin' = do i really have to lick it?"
"6653","short reply: you are right that ted-ed is wrong, and encapsulated the issue pretty well. the math can get a bit hairy - along the lines of the tables you showed from other comments - but the truth is the we were not given enough information. but with the best guesses, you have the same chances with the pair as with the singe frog. but both are more than 50%.

longer reply, first about the 50% chance of having a male+female in the pair. it's easiest to explain with coins. suppose you flip a gold coin and a silver coin. it seems obvious that there is a 25% chance of two heads or two tails, a 25% chance that the gold coin is heads and the silver is tails, and a 25% chance that the gold coin is tails and the silver coin is heads. yet your intuition is telling you, incorrectly, that this changes if the silver coin is replaced with an identical gold coin. but probability doesn't care if you can tell the difference between the coins; they are different in some way, even if it is that one lands closer to the door than the other. so call one ""coin #1"" and the other ""coin #2"", and you get the right result.

what the puzzle didn't tell us, is how often a male frog croak. or if females croak, but the male is more distinctive. i'll assume they don't, but that was ambiguous. 

the error ted-ed made, is that a fact is not the same thing as an event. ""there is a male in the pair"" is a fact. ""the first frog to croak since you realized you needed to find a female"" is an event, and it can be the single frog even if there is a male in the pair.

if the single frog is male, there is a 33% chance that it would croak first if both in the pair are male, a 50% chance if one in the pair is male, and a 100% chance if both in the pair are female. these events that didn't happen increase the chances that the single frog is female to 9/14 (about 64%). and ironically, the chances that the silent frog in the pair is female are also 9/14."
"6654","fuck feminism! female frog is a mary sue!! sjws are ruining our riddles!!!!11!!!"
"6655","so i haven't been able to stop thinking about this horrible riddle since this video... infected me with the knowledge of it. i follow the idea that 'at least one of these frogs are male' only eliminates 1 of the 4 possibilities-that where they're both female, f/f-and this leaves three possibilities-m/m, m/f, and f/m-leaving you a 2 in 3 shot at survival. i get that, but here's the thought i keep having that makes me want to pick up a bat and start breaking shit:

what if we know which of the two frogs that croaked? let's say instead of knowing that 'at least one of these frogs are male', we know that 'frog #1 is male'? then of our four possibilities-m/m, m/f, f/m, and f/f-we have to discard both possibility three and four in which the first frog is not male, leaving us with a 50% chance of survival. naturally the inverse also applies if the croaker happens to be frog #2.

so following the logic of this, you only get the 67% chance of survival if you dont know which of the two frogs in particular happened to croak. as soon as you learn which one croaked, your chances drop back down to 50/50. so i guess if you ever find yourself in this scenario, you better avoid at all costs checking which of the two frogs croak or you'll immediately cut your chances.

what the fuck is this shit, schrodinger's frog?"
"6656","what parameters affect the frequency of croaking in the frogs might have had some bearing on actual frogs - but the mathematical principle about conditional probabilities is correct in the ted video. the whole story with the frogs is just there for illustrative purposes, but the problem is true for anything where you have some initial probabilities about the system but then you learn something, which shrinks the space of possibilities, shifting the probabilities for your system."
"6657","the real issue is they heard of the monty hall problem and thought they could be clever applying it somewhere else, but they seemed to of forgotten a key part of that problem. in the original problem you are presented with three options two result in a loss and one in a win. this in combination with monty opening one of the doors that's a loser allows switching to be better and the quirky solution of 67% to show up. the issue is the monty hall problem and the frog problem differ in that monty always has 1 win and 2 losses while these frogs can be 3m 0f, 2m 1f, or 1m 2f. the rest of their video is just them sloppily applying the monty hall proof to the frog problem which only makes sense as long as you don't think too much because the proof requires a 2m 1f assumption that does not exist. without that assumption each frog is truly an independent event and therefore each as a 50% chance of being male."
"6658","armchair mathematician/logician here. the video is incorrect in its analysis and here's why: when eliminating the set of female/female, you have to elminate one of the two male/female sets as well. thankfully, for simplicity's sake, both sets produce an identical result so we don't need to further complicate the problem (that said, we could go further if it mattered which was male or female). since it doesn't matter, we can collapes it into a single (fe)male/-(fe)male outcome (if you still don't understand why, consider: only one of the two sets is possible in any given iteration of this problem.) therefore we have the male/male and (fe)male/-(fe)male outcomes. considering both are equally likely, we are left with a 50% probability. not a 67%."
"6659","shaun, the phd guy is correct even if you take in to consideration the increased chance of croaking in the case of 2 male frogs since we don't know the frequency of male frogs croaking and we also don't have time to run tests. we were lucky we heard a croaking noise at all which diverted our attention to a pair of frogs, thus increasing our chance of survival from 50% to 66.67%."
"6660","the reason that the mf combo is listed twice (this is all prior to any of the croaking analysis) is that you are twice as likely to encounter an mf pair as you are an mm pair or an ff pair. in other words, if you randomly pick two frogs (under the assumption that m and f frogs are equally likely), you'll get an mm pair 25% of the time, an ff pair 25% of the time, and an mf pair 50% of the time. that is what the 1:1:2 mm:ff:mf proportion represents."
"6661","okay, so, after reading the comments, i think the issue is people applying probability retroactively.
so, some people replaced the metaphor of the frogs with flipping coins and using premonitions to know the outcome of one of the coins before you flip it, but, when you think about it, in both cases it's basically a really complicated way of calculating your probabilities using half of the actual, real-world data, and probabilities aren't supposed to be calculated using data from what *actually happened*.
like, i can approach this problem by saying ""what a coincidence that there aren't any f/f pairings!"", but the entire problem is designed to artificially limit the sample space so that there aren't any f/f pairings (which is racist against lesbians).
it's also kind of like xeno's paradox, when you think about it. i mean, we can move--we can travel distances--but according to xeno's paradox we can't. at the same time, we know that the probability of a frog being male or female is 50%, but apparently that probability changes depending on how many other frogs we consider at the same time, but that would mean the probability of this individual frog being male or female is simultaneously 50% and 67% and 75% (etc.) and we know that can't be true.

i guess what i'm getting at is applying probabilities retroactively destroys the fabric of reality."
"6662","i disagree that the mathematical answer of the riddle is wrong but i do have some beef with how it's presented. the scenario with the frogs does in fact give us additional information that alters the probability severely. male frogs croak to attract females and warn other male frogs from their territory. so when we hear one frog croak the double female option is removed from the sample space. when we see the other just chilling there and they're not fighting or anything the double male option goes as well. so the probability of finding a female frog in the clearing is 100% barring genetic defects or chemicals in the water that have turned the friggin frogs gay."
"6663","the problem i have with the riddle has nothing to do with math. you here a frog croak an turn around and see 2 frogs, these two events are not necessarily connected, you did not see the frog croak so you are jumping to conclusions, there could be another frog or 10 or 100 hiding behind a rock or tree.this is where this problem fall apart for me."
"6664","watching the video, it sounds like at some point they flipped the order of events.  for narrative purposes, they have you hear the croak, and that draws your attention to the clearing.  in the order of events they present, i believe you are correct: there are lots of potential clearings, and the more male frogs in the clearing, the more likely you are to see that particular clearing.  good catch!

however, later in the video, they act as though the order was the reverse: you see the two frogs in the clearing, then you are lucky enough to hear a croak come from the clearing. it is much easier in this case to act as though the croak is a lucky piece of information beamed directly into your brain, and come to the same conclusions as the ted-ed video.  it still doesn't feel perfect to me, but it feels much more intuitive."
"6665","just imagine if you flipped two coins at once. if i told you one coin is heads, how likely is it that the second coin is tails? 2/3.

the original sample base still matters even with the new information that you know one is heads.  it matters that they were flipped at the same time.

those who think this problem is wrong are thinking like if the coins were flipped one after the other; as if i flipped a coin and it came up heads and i asked how likely the next flip will land on tails.

we didn't turn our heads to see one frog and then see another frog jump in and ask what gender that new frog is.  we started with the sample base of 2 frogs, both having a 50/50 chance each, and those odds still carry over with the new information."
"6666","there are two ways to get one male and one female: either frog 1 is male and frog 2 is female or frog 1 is female and 2 is male.  you have to count them separately because it is like flipping two coins: you could get a head and a tail if you flip the 1st coin and get heads and get tails on the second one (50% chance x 50% chance =25% chance of that combo), or if you get tails on the first and heads on the second (also a 25% of that combo, for at total ""one heads, one tails"" probability of 50%)."
"6667","hey! i know this is two years late, but i think i've explained this in a logical way with as little maths as possible. let me know if it helps!

here's what they're doing in theory:

we check the first frog and it's male, then we check the second frog and it's 50/50 m or f. so far our options are mm or mf. if we check the first frog and it's female, then we know the second is male, which only gives one fm combination. so in total we have mm, mf and fm. but that leaves us with two win conditions and one possible fail... 66% one is female, right?

wrong. because we can't follow the same logic as the example with no croaking. in the no croaking example, we see two frogs that both have a 50/50 chance of being male/female. so the initial decision doesn't matter, we'll either pick frog a and get 50/50 m or f, or pick frog b and get 50/50 m or f. the overall spread are all equally likely m f m f. which just simplifies to 50/50 m or f regardless of which frog you choose.

however in the croak example, we know one frog is a male. our initial decision of which frog to test matters, because one frog is 100% male and the other is 50/50 male or female. so our spread for the initial choice is m & m f. then we take our second round for 100% m frog. his second round is the ambiguous frog, which is 50/50 m or f. so our options are mm and mf. now if we pick the 50/50 frog first, we know that the second frog needs to be the one that croaked, which is 100% m. so those options are mm and fm (even though we don't need to collect a second round of the first is f).

in this scenario, the final options are mm, mf, mm and fm. two of four options have one female frog.

fifty. percent."
"6668","sorry for the laziness, but i really didn't feel like reading down through the comments to see if anyone mentioned this as that would have deflated all the fun out of being a super smarty pants :)  shaun, the reason why the two m/f possibilities exist despite seeming to be the exact same scenario is explained in the ted-ed video itself when he explains that the probability of any one frog being male or female is independent of the probability of any other frog being either male or female.  i think (but could be wrong)  that this relates to one of my favourite probability mantras.  the dice don't remember!  really glad i gave your channel a second chance bee tee dubs (btw)!"
"6669","so this is just a shite version of monty hall??"
"6670","come on shaun, all of those mathematical riddles aren't too be taken literally. they're just using real life examples for abstract concepts and don't take into account any variables that aren't mentioned.
while your criticism would apply to the same situation in reality it doesn't apply to this riddle, since once again, like everything in mathematics it's only supposed to be solved using the given information and logic, but no outside information"
"6671","way too late to comment but the biologist guy didn't seem to understand the difference between permutations and combinations. you correctly don't see why male-->female is different from female-->male, because it doesn't matter in the first example. he is asking for different combinations (order doesn't matter) but then treats it like a permutation problem (counting order)"
"6672","there are two major problems i see with this riddle. 
1. the first answer being ""wrong"" explanation only seemingly makes sense if you don't know which frog is male. essentially it's permutation vs combination, and they're solving for a permutation when the combination is what really matters. you're right, there is no difference between. a situation in which the order would matter would be if you could only choose to lick one of the two frogs, in which case, you'd only have a 25% chance by going to the field rather than a 50% chance at the stump. that's what the riddle should have been. but since you're allowed to lick both frogs, that 25% goes back up to 50%.

2. every single calculation they used to apply to the 2nd frog in the field could also be used on the frog alone on the stump, in relation to the male:female possible combinations. there is no distinguishable difference. they're basically saying ""this frog is further away, so statistics no longer apply to it."""
"6673","female/male|male/female are counted as two separate options because in some mathematical problems the order of these would matter. but here it doesn't, these two options are identical. it doesn't matter which frog sits on the left for example and it's also irrelevant which one you lick first. 10th grade math for the win..."
"6674","the problem is flawed. you only hear the male croak, not actually observe a male croaking, which in the animation you can see that a croaking male's throat expands quite visibly. turning around and seeing two frogs in a clearing (out of cover where their camouflage is apparently ineffective, which means there could be an effectively endless amount of non-visible frogs) is no real indication that you've seen the frog that you heard croaking. going after the two frogs is still the best choice, as you've got two frogs of unknown gender to lick.

pedantry saves lives."
"6675","combining ''gut feelings'' with statistics is the sign of being a wanker."
"6676","my reasoning is that if the male has a distinctive croak that the female doesn't, it's probably a mating call with which it attracts females (as frogs usually do). if two frogs are sitting together and one is making mating calls, that probably means the other is not interested and thereby more likely to be male as well (i'll assume that it being a lesbian frog is highly unlikely, because unlike with social species that raise their children, homosexuality is not evolutionarily useful for frogs). so go for the one on the stump."
"6677","""i'm ignorant and i don't get why they're different, but they're different"" well there's the entire problem that you have with this riddle in one neat sentence! they are different because either frog could be the male in the case where one is male and the other female, so these are two distinct realities. one where leftie is male and rightie is female and the other where it's switched. these are clearly two different scenarios, if you rock up to leftie in the scenario where she is a female and assume she's a male, she might get angry. so there are two ways how there can be 1 male and 1 female frog. only 1 way how there can be 2 males. if you switch their sex in that situations, their still both male. nothing changed. no new reality. and voila, 2/3 or 67%. 

the issue you raise with the frequency of croaking is interesting though, that would be interesting to look into mathematically. of course if you know the frequency is very short in which they croak, then in the 2 frogs case you can  almost be certain that there must be 1 female, because you only heard one croak. but i think the riddle is set up in a way where you have to make a very quick decision so that your decision time compared to the croaking frequency is short and that you can't really infer that... not sure."
"6678","if it's mating season and the males will die if they don't find a female, then what would two males be doing wasting their time standing around together? the other one of the pair is obviously female, and the croaker is trying to get with her."
"6679","i'm groggy and having trouble following, but this reminds me of that stupid gameshow doors problem, and how your chances supposedly magically go up to two out of three when one of the empty doors is opened.

maybe that would be true if you were given the ability to open two of the doors yourself, but that's not what the situation is. it's actually a fakeout, of a 50% chance originally being disguised as a 33.333333333% chance. the gameshow people knew that door was empty, and they opened it for you before you were given the opportunity to choose any door. it was never a matter of thirds to begin with!"
"6680","i am no math wizard either, but i can explain why the male-female pair is counted twice.

it might be simpler to think of the frogs as a pair of values in a 2x1 matrix. let's say 0 is female and 1 is male (it's arbitrary which number represents which). you have the frogs sitting to the left and right of each other, so, if there is one male and one females they could be represented as follows:

 [0 1] (female on the left and male on the right) or [1 0] (male on the left and female on the right). 

both of these possibilities are instances with one male and one female, but they are not the same scenario. either one is a possibility, so we have to count both when we're enumerating probabilities. they could also both be male ([1 1]), but we've ruled out that they're both female ([0 0]).

i hope this clarifies. if there were 3 frogs instead, then we would know that *at least* one was male, but we still wouldn't know which one it was, so we'd have to count every permutation that includes at least one male, not just one of them. i think with three frogs it's a little easier to immediately see why we'd have to do that. 

if you know that at least one is male, then [1 0 0] (the male on the left), [0 1 0] (male in the center), and [0 0 1] (the male on the right) are all equally possible. of course, all of the possibilities where two or all three were male are also possible and must be counted as well, but they're irrelevant to this explanation. 

now, the one thing that i'm not sure about, and that i'd have to ask a mathematician, is why we don't have to distinguish the individuals of a given sex from each other when considering permutations. for instance, let's represent the males by mx (m for male followed by a number that distinguishes them from each other). going back to the example of two frogs, for simplicity, when we're talking about *all of the distinct possibilities,* why do we not distinguish between the following:

[m1 m2] [m2 m1]

obviously every combination of two females is removed from consideration for the same reason, but having male #1 on the left and male #2 on the right is not technically the same possibility as having male #2 on the left and male #1 on the right, so why don't both possibilities contribute to our calculation of probabilities? maybe some mathematician in the comment section can answer this. my only guess would be that, because we can't distinguish between individual male frogs, we only count all of the combinations of male+male once... but if there are two combinations that can be consider as that outcome, then doesn't it need to be weighted against outcomes which are unique? that's what i don't get."
"6681","here's the problem shaun: its an analogy for a purely mathematical statistical model. it's supposed to be taken completely at face value without any further analysis because it's merely teaching a simple mathematical concept. this happens all the time in early physics classes: you're given an absurdly simplified scenario in which you dont have to account for friction, drag, things like terminal velocity, and so on. you simply learn a formula like d=1/2gt^2, are told something falls from a height and to figure out how long it takes to fall. 

that's what this frog video is. it's an absurdly simplified situation to merely illustrate a mathematical concept. the moment you start to examine it it falls apart because it's intentionally removed from reality to illustrate the concept in its simplest form"
"6682","probably gone over already, thought i'd talk about it anyway:

first of all, as to why male/female and female/male are counted as two distinct possibilities: you have two frogs, and you don't know which one croaked. as such, you can't determine which of the frogs is male, only that one of them must be male. essentially, while it can be said that one of the two frogs must be male, it cannot be said that either of them is definitively male.

second of all, concerning the possibility of the male/male scenario being more likely: as is explained in the ted-ed video's section on conditional probability, the information we have available affects the probability of any given scenario being true or false, and at this point you're adding more information to the scenario. we have no means of determining whether or not each frog croaks at a consistent rate, what that rate would even be, whether or not these frogs croak at the same time, and so on. while these things may very well have an impact on the probability of any given scenario being more or less likely, they simply aren't known to us and, as such, aren't ideas that we can use to derive a probability of finding a female frog in the bunch.
to illustrate this faulty reasoning in another example: since we don't know anything about this frog's distinctive croak, it's entirely possible that males only croak when they're mating. if that's the case, then we could consider the probability of whether or not the pair of frogs contains a female frog to have some root in the prevalence of homosexuality in this species of frog. it may very well be the case that the probability of there being a female in the pair is greater than 75%."
"6683","oh no , game theory"
"6684","shut up and lick the frogs"
"6685","my issue with the riddle is also the croaking, but it's different than yours.  see, it would, logically, take some time and a lot of effort to discern a frog croak in the middle of the jungle.  i can't accept that it's easier to hear a croak, turn around, see 2 frogs, then try and identify whether the croak was male or female, than it is to just keep running towards to original lone frog.  so, the odds, are, at best,  50-50, but in reality you might as well just keep running towards the frog already in your sights."
"6686","i would like to say that i have been criticizing this riddle for years and i have been taught conditional probability by multiple teachers. i would like to tell you that you don't need to be any good at math to disprove this riddle. the reason this riddle makes no sense is because the person who designed it tried to use statistics to over-complicate things, and in the process of doing that he made a really stupid error. the person who created this riddle also was not a statistician and actually failed high school calculus"

"6688","their video basicly justifies a gamblers fallacy. if you flip a coin once, it's a 50/50 chance to get tails. if you flip a coin twice and one of the results is heads, the second flip still has a 50/50 chance to come up tails. nothing has changed."
"6689","i hate this. it's late and i've been looking at the comments on this video for about an hour. was this your plan when you uploaded this video, shaun? was it??"
"6690","let me see if i can explain why the answer is 2/3 in a way that should be easy to understand and intuitive, but that won't just be parroting the same logic as others. so, the setup:
 we have two frogs. we know that one of them is male. this means that in all possible outcomes, one of the frogs is male. to find the probability that one of them is female we need to know 2 things: 
1) how many outcomes are possible if there is at least one male frog?
2) how many outcomes include one female, and one male?
we can divide the number of options from question 2 by the number of options from question 1, and that will give us the probability that we want. this is true because we are dividing the number of outcomes where we live by all possible outcomes. you can understand this by thinking of dice. the chance of rolling an even number is (3/6) because there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. we are doing the same thing, looking for (successes/possibilities.) 

so, question 1: how many outcomes are possible if there is at least one male frog?
 i saw a few people below me asking why we count mf twice, but mm only once. we cannot tell any frogs apart, but we can tell the frog on the right from the frog on the left. that's why there are 3: mm, mf, and fm. mm should not be counted twice because, to put it simply, we can't tell the outcome mm from the outcome mm. we can tell fm from mf, though, which is why it counts twice.

question 2 then: how many outcomes include one female and one male? 
this one is easy now, the answer is 2: mf and fm. 

so, our probability is (2/3)."
"6691","mathamatical theories are nice, but you could do and experiment. set up some fake frogs, male ,and female. radomized it. put malem female on the bottom. have person do the croaking. oh, that diagram, in reality, there would be the possibilty of being two femal frogs. do you see what i mean? radomly it could be: male,male. female male. and female female. just from writing this, if the female, male was okay, then the addition of the female female must be good too. right?"
"6692","{frog1=male,frog2=male} == {frog2=male, frog1=male} see the set (mathematics) article on wikipedia, the order of the sets does not matter

"6693","i think your reasoning is fine, but i think you're adding in a time dimension that the riddle is not supposed to include ;) 

i think the reason behind the 67% number versus 50% hinges on whether m/f and f/m are actually the same thing.
the logic seems to be that if you knew which frog was male, the odds would be 50% for the other one, but since you don't know, m/f and f/m are different outcomes, which gives you 67%. 

i don't agree with this logic... i think the riddle may be stated in a way that makes m/f and f/m the same, but it was supposed to keep that probability space open, but it just doesn't, narratively. 
narratively, one of these frogs has a 50% chance of being female, and the other is irrelevant, and we simply don't know which is which. it'd make more sense to say that, if you only had time to lick one of the frogs, you should go for the 50% instead of risking the 67% chance that you'd die because you chose between m/f and f/m wrongly."
"6694","the answer becomes obvious when you distinguish between the male that croaked and any other male. the real possibility space is;

"6696","i don't see why position matters in this problem. you're licking both frogs, one definitely male (no matter where it was) and one which could be male or female  with a 50% chance for each.
moreover, why are we expected to assume that these are the only three frogs? the croak didn't necessarily come from the clearing, it simply came from ""the left"". if the croak came from an unseen frog, the probability of licking a female frog becomes 75%, because now position does matter, as we do not have information on either frog."
"6697","but ted-ed is satire"
"6698","wouldn't you have to factor in other frog behaviors too? maybe the males and females don't lime to spend much time together, decreasing the probability of the croakers companion being female"

"6700","every time i hear that organ music all i can see is naked terry jones playing the organ. god help me."
"6701","what most people don´t get is that male/female and female/male is different, that´s the crux of this riddle. usually, with no croaking ther would be a 50 percent chance that one frog is male and one frog is female, 25% chance both are male and 25% both are female. with the croaking, the 25% chance both are female is getting eliminated, leaving the 66/33 chance at the end.

(just the basic point of the original video, your point that there are different parameters in nature, that make those kind of logicpuzzlese generally inapplicable in nature is, of course, true)"
"6702","good point about the frequency of croaking. if they croak infrequently then  hearing a croak would be more likely if they are both males. if they croak frequently then the fact that you didn't hear two makes it likely the other one is a female. 

however, we are obviously not supposed to take that reasoning into account since we do not know that. 

i think the answer is wrong and i really don't understand why any complicated maths is required.  i think the mistake is that it is simply fallacious  to assume that the rules of a random set somehow magically apply to a single unknown frog, especially since we have a piece of information (one croaked) that makes it not a random set anymore.

it's like flipping a coin that lands heads 7 times in a row, trying to predict the next flip and reasoning ""it's much more likely for 8 flips to include at least one tails rather than all heads therefore the next flip is more likely to be tails."""
"6703","isn't it just a reskin of the monty hall problem though?"
"6704","okay, i know i'm late to this, and you've probably stopped caring, but math puzzles is kind of my thing, so i can't resist sharing.

first of all, the question of croaking frequency and how that affects your odds.  strictly speaking, you're not wrong to worry about this because that's exactly the kind of stupid little gotcha that these sorts of puzzle writers like to slip in.  you think to yourself, ""okay, he's telling me this little story to make it more engaging, but the information i'm meant to take from it is that at least one of these frogs is male.""  you form your answer based on that, and then in the solution, the author shouts ""gotcha!  you were supposed to infer that hearing a croak meant there was a greater than average chance of having two males because blah blah blah.""  so i don't fault you for getting hung up on that, but when it comes to understanding the solution... you kind of have to just take it as read that they were just coming up with a colorful way of telling you ""at least one of the two frogs is male"".

as for how they came up with the 2/3 probability, i'm just going to copy and paste what i put in hbomberguy's thread, hopefully it'll clear things up.

the intuitive problem is that you're told you have two frogs and at least one is male.  therefore, the other frog is either male or female.  50/50, right?

the problem is, we're treating these frogs as if they're indistinguishable.  let's give them names.  let's call them adrian and chris, to be reasonably androgynous.

there are four possible situations:

adrian is male and chris is male.
adrian is female and chris is male.
adrian is male and chris is female.
adrian is female and chris is female.

that's why we count female/male and male/female.  one situation is that adrian is female, the other is that chris is female.

all of these situations are equally likely until we're told that at least one of them must be male.  then we can rule out the last possibility, which leaves us with only 3 possible situations, 2 of which will save our life.  2/3.

the maths of probability are some of the stupidest i've ever worked with, and puzzles like this are designed to trip up your intuitive idea of what the possibilities are, so... yeah.  something to keep in mind if you like these sorts of puzzles, or to discard if you don't."
"6705","the reasons male female is counted twice is you dont know with frog is male. the sample space include all possible states for all frogs 

look up the monty paradox you'll like it."
"6706","the unstated assumption in the original riddle is that croaking is a rare event. if the frogs croak once every 10 years on average, then the original analysis holds. we would basically know that we've just witnessed a rare event and at least one of the frogs on the left is male. if the frogs croak 10 times a second on average, then we should go to the right. either we're witnessing an extremely rare stretch of silence for a male frog or that frog is female."

"6715","the sequence of frogs does not matter. regardless of which frog made the distinct croaked all following scenarios still leave you with 2-1 frogs remaining which is still just 50/50 odds. this is a demonstration of a gambler's fallacy.

like so: female or male and left or right.
fl fr not possible
fl mr possible
ml mr possible
ml fr possible
this seems like the whole set but now we apply the fact that the croak had to come from one of them
fl fr as stated above it is not possible (0 outcomes)
fl mr croak can only be from right frog (1 outcome)
ml mr croak can be from either left or right frog (2 outcomes)
ml fr croak can only be from left frog (1 outcome)
so that's 2 outcomes with 2 males and two outcomes with 1 female.

it would be no different than arguing that you have a higher probability of flipping a coin to heads after a flip to tails. no previous proven result effects the outcome of any new results with the same probability.

just as an example try figuring out 3 frogs and 2 simultaneous croaks. regardless of the order of frogs you are still only left with one 50/50 frog in the end."
"6716","it does make sense:
you know at least one frog is male:
so there are three combinatiosn:
fm
mf
mm

fm and mf are independent solutions;

imagine you have a bag of equal numbers of red and blue coloured beads 
if you take one you always have a 50% chance of getting red or blue
if you put the bead back and repeat you still have a 50% chance, as the number of beads is equal still

so your first pull is:
50% red, 50% blue
and your second
50% red 50% blue

if you pull blue first then you can either get blue again or red
if you pull red first you can either get blue or red again
none of this probabities effect each other
there are four out comes:
blue then blue
blue then red
red then blue
red then red
each are equal in chance and so 25% chance each

now what we can say is ""if you know you have at least one blue, what is the chances that you have a red""
of the outcomes that contain a blue;
blue then blue 
blue then red
blue then blue
each has an equal chance to happen and so each is 1/3 chance

each pull is still independent, what changes the probability is the fact you know what the outcome is (at least one blue) and so any other outcome can be ignored. 


you are very much correct though; the issue with the riddle is the crock, as with two frogs that's twice the chance they crocked compared to just one male."
"6717","this riddle reminds me of this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1csftdxxuly"
"6718","i was thinking a about a different ""error"". say, you have a pop of 20. 10 female, 10 male. there is a 1/2 chance of picking a male, same for female. but if you pick a male, then the chances change. for the next pick you are slightly more likely to pick a female. which means for the riddle, that the male-male combination is less likely than a male-female or female-male. (but this depends on population size, but since you cant have infinite frogs, there will always be a slight decrease in the chance of getting male-male). a silly ""error"", but so is the one in your video :)"
"6719","dumb as fuck. it's just like saying: you have a frog of unknown sex in a box. there's a 50-50 chance that it's female. now you drop a frog you know is male in the box. you close the lid and jumble it around. you open it and voila, now there's a 2/3rd chance you have a female frog in the box."
"6720","to explain why m/f is a seperate possibility to f/m: imagine naming the frogs.  say we call one sarg and the other moly.  these are distinct individuals.  they each, independantly of one another, run the 50/50 chance.  so what you're asking is why isn't mr sarg and mrs moly the same possibility as mrs sarg and mr moly?  see, when you name the frogs, it makes clear the difference.  and it's exactly this kind of easily-done individual / condition mixup that a lot of gambling preys on.

try it out with a pair of coins.  flip them 100 times.  you'll get roughly 25% double heads, 25% double tails, 50% one of each.  that's because ""one of each"" covers two different possibilities.  they don't look different to you only because you can't tell the coins apart but if you could - say if one coin was red and the other was blue - you'd easily be able to tell them apart, but (and this is how it makes sense) changing the colour of the coins to help you distinguish them better doesn't actually affect the odds of getting one of each (or of anything else).

hope this helps clear that up for you!  :)"
"6721","you may actually have something here.  they've unintentionally introduced another factor into it, via the way they've gone about translating a dry maths puzzle into a fun frogs puzzle.  it doesn't actually affect the outcome whatsoever, so the video's still correct.  but it's a good thing to notice.  you should get into maths, maybe.  if you can apply a talent for picking holes in things, outside of the limits of metaphor imperfections, that's a great skill in maths."
"6722","there are 4 possibilities that have the same probability of occuring of  1/4 : either they are both males, both females, the left one is female and the right one male, or the left one male and the right one female ; hence the fact that the pair one male one female is counted twice. (that's overly simplifying the amazonian frog's sexual specter if i remember my jurassic park correctly...)

i agree with you on the fact that if both are male there is more chance that one of them will be croaking at that moment. when you take that into account, by saying for example that there is a probability p that a male frog does croak during a given amount of time and condition not only by the fact that one of them must be male but also by the fact that this male must croak, your chances with the clearing greatly depends on p. i won't detail the math here, but the closer p is to 1, the closer the probability is to 2/3, and when p is close to zero, your chances goes toward 50/50 (slightly superior, but at the limit you get 50/50). 

of course, i don't take into account here the fact that if both are males you might here multiple croaks and say that your mushroomed brain can only be sure to have heard at least one croak. i you don't make that simplification, you would have to make a far nastier modelisation (is it the same frog that croaked twice ? does the odds of that happening are big ?) with exponantial clocks and stuff like that, but it would still give you a probability bigger than 1/2, and even bigger than 2/3 in some cases (the fact that you only heard one croaked actually reduces the odds of both of them being males)."
"6723","if you aren't convinced by thinking about sample spaces, let's reframe the problem so that we're dealing with one random variable: n, the number of female frogs. this should sidestep the issue altogether.
n has this distribution (and draw yourself a tree diagram to convince yourself of this):
p(n = 0) = 1/4
p(n = 1) = 1/2
p(n = 2) = 1/4
we are told that n is less than 2, and then asked the probability n is greater than 0. clearly this is the same as asking p(n=1) *given that* n is 1 or 0, or in other words, what is the ratio of p(1 female) to p(1 female or 0 females).
you can calculate this as 1/2 / (1/4 + 1/2)  = 2/3"
"6724","can i just say to stay the hell away from maths....
it hurts my brain..."
"6725","he frogg"
"6726","their explanation can easily be confirmed to be correct by simply using a probability tree. in the case of the two frogs, you'd use a binary tree. the two distinct fm and mf pairs are important to be distinct, and you'll notice this is true with the probability tree you'll end up with no matter how many frogs you have. try it with a more difficult problem: 4 frogs. the likelihood of there being at least 1 female frog out of 4 is most definitely not 1/2, and the respective probability tree for that will prove it."
"6727","i keep fish and frogs. i currently have two male frogs and one female frog. actual solution: wait until dark, the males never shut up. ever."
"6728","logic beats mathematics on this one. in one direction you have a frog that have 50% percent chance of being female and in the other direction you have a frog that have another frog with 50% chance of being female with a male in the side. the male is useless in this riddle. i gess you dont even have to use probabilistics here."
"6729","essentially the first answer is like that because if you have 2 frogs and at least one is male, then either 1) the frog on the left is the male you heard or 2) the frog on the right is the male you heard. you don't know which one croaked because you didn't see it. if you had seen it, then you'd know that the frog that croaked needed to be discounted, and you'd only have one frog to consider. but you're not considering one frog - you are asked if the pair contains a female!
if you had no audio cues, you'd be presented with this: frog on the left (l) and frog on the right (r). each individual frog has a 50/50 chance of being male (m) or female (f). so the possibilities for each frog are:
lf, lm and rf, rm. so each frog could be either. all the unique combinations are thus: lf + rf; lf + rm; lm + rf; lm +rm. like this, we see that there is a 75% chance that the pair contains a female: both frogs being female, left-frog being female (and right male), right-frog being female (and left male). despite the last two scenarios being one male and one female, they are distinct because they are describing two different frogs. each frog has it's own probability of being female, and thus must be considered separately. the 50/50 probability is associated with each individual frog, so ""l"" and ""r"" are different events so lf+rm=/=lm+rf, because l=/=r.
the remaining possibility is that both frogs are male, 25%. this works because we've been told that there's a 50/50 chance of a frog being female/male - so the chance of each combination is equal.
if we go back to your second point, adding the fact that we know that ff is impossible and that we heard one croak, then we consider the possibility of the following combinations again:
lf + rm(croaks)
lm(croaks) + lf
lm(croaks) + rm
lm + rm (croaks)
which, you'll note, means that if we went by the videos logic (which i'm not sure i'd agree with but i feel like that particular stats thing was maybe not how i was thinking it - i was working with sequences and the fact that lf has a 50% chance of occurring, which would mean a sequential rm after lf would be 100%, making lf + rm = 50% rather than 33.3% and lm+rf = 25% and lm + rm = 25% but that might be bollocks, hence it being 75% but for different reasons than they stated) that knowing something croaked makes the probability 67%, because each combination is equal, then you actually end up with 50%. the same odds. because with two males present, there's two outcomes for which croaked (and a small unconsidered likelihood that they both should have croaked, which would lower the odds of them both being male and make the odds of there being a female >50% like shaun said - the outcome of this being yeah, go for the two frogs). 
i mean i think the main problem with this is that the assumption of the croak raising the probability is... incorrect. is actually lowers the probability, because if there was no croak you'd be unable to rule out them both being female and having a 75% of survival."
"6730","i probably won't solve the discord that resulted on this mess on the commentary section, but, although is a 1 year old video by the time i'm writing this, i will give a try because this is getting on my nerves for no reason whatsoever.

the problem here is that both the ones claiming that the probability is 50% and the ones claiming it's ~67% are right, because they are analyzing different things.

the ones that say it's 50% they are not wrong in the fact that there being a male doesn't change the probability for the other frog. so if i know 1 of them is male the other one still has 50% chance of being female. the problem here is that we're not analizing each frog separately, we're analyzing the pair. the question proposed by the problem is ""what's the probability that exists at least one famale frog in the pair, knowing that one of them is male?"". now i will enter on the same calculations as the others(considering that the croaking doesn't affect the probabilities)

in the case of analysing the pair the answer of ~67% is correct. when looking at the pair, to try in avoid misunderstandings, let's analyse as both separates parts and then unite the pair.
there four possible combinations on the total that are:
mm=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
mf=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
fm=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%
ff=(0.5)*(0.5)=25%

but, actually, for the pair i have 3 posibilities:
case 1: the pair of both males(or no females)
p2m=p0f=mm=25%
case 2:the pair with 1 male(or 1 female)
p1m=p1f=mf+fm=50%
case 3:the pair with no males(or 2 females)
p0m=p2f=ff=25%

knowing that i have at least 1 male in that pair excludes case 3 of the equation. so what is the probability of the pair being composed of opposite sexes?
case 2 is what i want and case 1+case 2 is the total. so the probability is what i want divided by the total, putting the values we have (50%/(25%+50%))~67%.
what this probability means is that if i lick both frogs i have 67% percent of licking a female on the process. if i pick one of them and lick then the chance of it being female would be lower actually as you already have 50% chance of getting de male one and 50% of getting the unknown one. the actual probability of me picking a female in this case would be (0.5*(2/3))~33%.

i hope this explain it."
"6731","""i don't even remember the order of operations.""

what the fuck is the order of operations."
"6732","i think i might have a lot of questions."
"6733","what's the order of operations?"
"6734","but are the frogs gayyyy?!"
"6735","i don't think you are wrong. the croaking complicates things."
"6736","the only major problem i see here is that you're supposed to assume the populations of female to male frogs is 1:1 when you don't actually know how many frogs they are male to female 

now the dilemma with the two frogs is correct in my eyes each frog can either be male or female so frog1 has a 1:1 chance the frog2 has a 1:1 chance but the frogs cannot possibly both be female causing a bull so you end up with the 3 answers frog 1 is male frog 2 is male m:m, frog 1 is male frog 2 is female f:m, frog 1 is female frog 2 is male m:f, f:m and m:f are different results because they are two individual frogs, so that means you have a 1:3 chance for situation 1, 2 and 3"
"6737","the actual answer is that male frogs croak to attract female frogs to mate. you ignore all the stupid fake math bullshit and instead use real world knowledge to come to a conclusion. you heard a croak, and turned to see two frogs. one of them is female, otherwise the male wouldn't have croaked."
"6738","both directions have equal chance because all frogs are independent of one another. so you have one frog to think about on each side"
"6739","while i do not like anita because she has lied and straight up made up shit about games, thunderfoot is also wrong. very wrong. like...5 minute google searches could find this."
"6740","i have to give it to you, that was pretty good. accusing tf of being the cherrypicker to turn away people's attention from you yourself being the cherrypicker. and averybody bought that."
"6741","tf started out doing creationist-busting videos, then moved on to science videos, which is his expert field. he was successful enough at that to come to rely on the income from yt. sadly, to maintain his views, he chose to move into socio-political commentary, and revealed a host of unexamined prejudices and frankly shitty attitudes.

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."
"6742","back when i was still angry, drinking a lot and watching ppl like tf, sargon etc. i never bothered watching anita's videos or searching for different perspectives that could have altered my view. i already ""knew"" what kind of a person she was so why should i? this was quite a while ago and i never gave that shit much thought again - only recently did i start actually challenging the views i actively held back then: anita is definitely more competent and constructive than the version of her i held some weird, constructed grudge against. thanks for this video, shaun."
"6743","thunderfoot is a creep..."
"6744","so glad to be out of the anti-sjw echo chamber, just like sjws they find the boogeyman everywhere and its a pretty depressing life."
"6745","i used to watch thunderf00t back when he mostly made videos about ken ham and wbc and stuff like that.  but then one day it's like his fucking brain broke and all of a sudden there's no more light-hearted jabs at religious fundamentalist extremists, and instead a neverending tirade against feminism in general and anita sarkeesian in particular.  it was so fuckin weird.  and now he's so fucking stupid that it makes me afraid to go back and look at his videos about ken ham.  were they fuckin' stupid too, and was i too stupid to realize it?  thunderf00t freaks me out."

"6749","17:23 hm, a little something to add here is that, just maybe, a rating does not equal an audience.
lets pick movies as an example: ""the theory of everything"" (the stephen hawkins biographical drama, in case someone does not know) is rated fsk0 (the german rating system for films, the ""usk"" being the same just for games, certifying something as admissible for everyone (fsk0) or people 6 (fsk6), 12 (fsk12) or 18 (fsk18) years and older, a system i am more accustom too and actually find a little better than the american ratings), or going with american ratings pg-13. does that make it a child s move (or even a movie for young teens)? obviously not, it is relatively unlikely that someone at that age already knows anything about the man, let alone cares about his life or his relationship with his wife.
or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."
"6750","never tought i'd feel sympathy for her one day... guess antis-sjw bother me more than anita now. time sure changes."
"6751","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"6752","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."
"6753","i really don't get thunderf00t sometimes. his content on science and debunking pseudoscience is interesting and generally quite thoughtful (he does have something against batteries though it seems). 

glad i'm not the only one to noticed his odd anti-sjw stuff. it really doesn't fit with his usually high standards."
"6754","sarkeesian is an idiot. thunderf00t ftw"
"6755","it bothers me way more than it should that this dude say midrift instead of midriff"
"6756","they commit every sin the claim sjws do. but that's ok, cause they're the good guys!"
"6757","well, this takes the fun out of watching thunderf00t mock the people who _actually_ deserve to be mocked."
"6758","i'm glad thunderf00t jumped off the anti sjw bandwagon and mostly just does science videos again. he knows his stuff when it comes to the field that he actually has expertise in. looking back it's pretty embarrassing how much he straw maned and obsessed about anita."
"6759","something i always found ironic and stupid about the hate for anita... she did exactly what the activist end of gaming wanted, treated games with the same critique framework as other media.  show her videos to someone who works in tv, movies, or publishing and they go 'well yeah, this is really old news, why is this significant?', but her detractors seemed to want games to take their rightful place of respect among other media, but somehow not connect to culture in the same way?"
"6760","i personally can't stand her. but she's doing something right if all these ""rationals"" are so upset by her."
"6761","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"6762","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"6763","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"6764","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."
"6765","i haven't seen much of anita and i've only heard of people whining about her but after seeing this she actually seems pretty reasonable"
"6766","middle aged slightly fat man. lol"
"6767","all these videos painting sarkeesian as a rational human being is going to make me going to have to go in and be immaculate in criticism about her.  why won't anyone do criticism of her justice?"
"6768","also, the implication that 'adult' games are immune to social criticism is hilarious."
"6769","thunderf00t is in love with anita sarkeesian and manifests his love like an 8-year-old boy."
"6770","people like thunderf00t give atheism a bad name"
"6771","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."
"6772","what does the sj on his sunglasses stand for?"
"6773","20:45 i don't see why they don't. of course if you have a prejudiced concept about certain roles and how characters filling that role should dress, most likely in a way that suits the direct function of that role, you're seem right.
but you'd then have to explain outfits in any situation where it's not functional"
"6774","reading these comments, its amazing to see how you've influenced people into reconsidering their own thinking. thank you so much for all of your hard work"
"6775","are you doing alright over there?"
"6776","wish i'd found you earlier, shaun."
"6777","i swear to god, these same exact videos were being made 6 years ago. can gamers ever talk about new things?"

"6781","thanks for pointing this out, i have been completely uncritical then thunderfoot talked about feminism"
"6782","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"6783","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"6784","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"6785","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"6786","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"6787","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"6788","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"6789","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"6790","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"6791","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."
"6792","wow....im highly disappointed by thunderf00t,  i mean...he is a scientist...."
"6793","yeah, thunderf00ts obsession with anita sarkeesian is why i unsubscribed. i subbed for athiesm talk."
"6794","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.

"6799","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"6800","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"6803","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"6804","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"6805","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"6806","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"6807","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."

"6812","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"6813","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"6814","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"6815","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"6816","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"6825","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."

"6849","17:23 hm, a little something to add here is that, just maybe, a rating does not equal an audience.
lets pick movies as an example: ""the theory of everything"" (the stephen hawkins biographical drama, in case someone does not know) is rated fsk0 (the german rating system for films, the ""usk"" being the same just for games, certifying something as admissible for everyone (fsk0) or people 6 (fsk6), 12 (fsk12) or 18 (fsk18) years and older, a system i am more accustom too and actually find a little better than the american ratings), or going with american ratings pg-13. does that make it a child s move (or even a movie for young teens)? obviously not, it is relatively unlikely that someone at that age already knows anything about the man, let alone cares about his life or his relationship with his wife.
or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."
"6850","never tought i'd feel sympathy for her one day... guess antis-sjw bother me more than anita now. time sure changes."
"6851","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"6852","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."
"6853","i really don't get thunderf00t sometimes. his content on science and debunking pseudoscience is interesting and generally quite thoughtful (he does have something against batteries though it seems). 

glad i'm not the only one to noticed his odd anti-sjw stuff. it really doesn't fit with his usually high standards."
"6854","sarkeesian is an idiot. thunderf00t ftw"
"6855","it bothers me way more than it should that this dude say midrift instead of midriff"
"6856","they commit every sin the claim sjws do. but that's ok, cause they're the good guys!"
"6857","well, this takes the fun out of watching thunderf00t mock the people who _actually_ deserve to be mocked."
"6858","i'm glad thunderf00t jumped off the anti sjw bandwagon and mostly just does science videos again. he knows his stuff when it comes to the field that he actually has expertise in. looking back it's pretty embarrassing how much he straw maned and obsessed about anita."
"6859","something i always found ironic and stupid about the hate for anita... she did exactly what the activist end of gaming wanted, treated games with the same critique framework as other media.  show her videos to someone who works in tv, movies, or publishing and they go 'well yeah, this is really old news, why is this significant?', but her detractors seemed to want games to take their rightful place of respect among other media, but somehow not connect to culture in the same way?"
"6860","i personally can't stand her. but she's doing something right if all these ""rationals"" are so upset by her."
"6861","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"6862","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"6863","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"6864","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."
"6865","i haven't seen much of anita and i've only heard of people whining about her but after seeing this she actually seems pretty reasonable"
"6866","middle aged slightly fat man. lol"
"6867","all these videos painting sarkeesian as a rational human being is going to make me going to have to go in and be immaculate in criticism about her.  why won't anyone do criticism of her justice?"
"6868","also, the implication that 'adult' games are immune to social criticism is hilarious."
"6869","thunderf00t is in love with anita sarkeesian and manifests his love like an 8-year-old boy."
"6870","people like thunderf00t give atheism a bad name"
"6871","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."
"6872","what does the sj on his sunglasses stand for?"
"6873","20:45 i don't see why they don't. of course if you have a prejudiced concept about certain roles and how characters filling that role should dress, most likely in a way that suits the direct function of that role, you're seem right.
but you'd then have to explain outfits in any situation where it's not functional"
"6874","reading these comments, its amazing to see how you've influenced people into reconsidering their own thinking. thank you so much for all of your hard work"
"6875","are you doing alright over there?"
"6876","wish i'd found you earlier, shaun."
"6877","i swear to god, these same exact videos were being made 6 years ago. can gamers ever talk about new things?"
"6878","so i thought this guy was smart and i realize now why that is. he is just the like a voice actor for a group who writes the script for him!"
"6879","funderfoot"
"6880","thunderf00t just loves making the same videos multiple times.. anita, solar roadways, water from air, hyperloop, elon musk, ect.."
"6881","thanks for pointing this out, i have been completely uncritical then thunderfoot talked about feminism"
"6882","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"6883","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"6884","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"6885","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"6886","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"6887","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"6888","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"6889","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"6890","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"6891","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."
"6892","wow....im highly disappointed by thunderf00t,  i mean...he is a scientist...."
"6893","yeah, thunderf00ts obsession with anita sarkeesian is why i unsubscribed. i subbed for athiesm talk."
"6894","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.
i'm very glad you made this video, shaun. it's even more eye opening now."
"6895","i love all of thunders science videos where he debunks impossible go fund me campaigns but he doesn't know politics"
"6896","i mean... rek'sai is a chick and she's a weird land shark insect alien. don't that count?"
"6897","thunder wants her bad...."
"6898","i don't like either anita or thunderfoot. .__."
"6899","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"6900","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."
"6901","she hurt that mans pride once"
"6902","""secret love letters to anita sarkeesian""

"6903","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"6904","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"6905","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"6906","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"6907","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."
"6908","sarkeesean:

"6909","i recently met anita. i was sitting about two feet from her. i noticed two things. she is kind of cute, and she is quite petite. the fact that all these ""alpha males"" are so terrified of this five-foot-tall woman is hilarious."
"6910","wow that's a lot of intellectual dishonesty from a ""skeptical"" person"
"6911","cuck cuck cuck, cuckoldy fucking cuck. cuck fell down and cuck turned brown, then cuck called oppression while turning it around. cuck got a stiffy for anita sarkeesian, cuck cums in a jiffy, but something seems iffy, 'coz what cuck doesn't know, is anita sarkeesian's a poe."
"6912","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"6913","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"6914","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"6915","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"6916","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"6922","gauging by the dislike ratio, it seems thunderfoot doesn't have as many fans as, say sargon. interesting how the ratios can fluctuate depending on who your subject is. really makes you think ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh? no not really. keep up the good work sir."
"6923","when someone labeled ted cruz tells you to ""stick to science"", and some 200 people agree with him.... i actually don't know what that means, it is a highly confusing scenario to be honest."
"6924","i feel like nobody ever actually defends anita they just attack the people who attack her"
"6925","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

"6949","17:23 hm, a little something to add here is that, just maybe, a rating does not equal an audience.
lets pick movies as an example: ""the theory of everything"" (the stephen hawkins biographical drama, in case someone does not know) is rated fsk0 (the german rating system for films, the ""usk"" being the same just for games, certifying something as admissible for everyone (fsk0) or people 6 (fsk6), 12 (fsk12) or 18 (fsk18) years and older, a system i am more accustom too and actually find a little better than the american ratings), or going with american ratings pg-13. does that make it a child s move (or even a movie for young teens)? obviously not, it is relatively unlikely that someone at that age already knows anything about the man, let alone cares about his life or his relationship with his wife.
or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."
"6950","never tought i'd feel sympathy for her one day... guess antis-sjw bother me more than anita now. time sure changes."
"6951","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"6952","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."
"6953","i really don't get thunderf00t sometimes. his content on science and debunking pseudoscience is interesting and generally quite thoughtful (he does have something against batteries though it seems). 

glad i'm not the only one to noticed his odd anti-sjw stuff. it really doesn't fit with his usually high standards."
"6954","sarkeesian is an idiot. thunderf00t ftw"
"6955","it bothers me way more than it should that this dude say midrift instead of midriff"
"6956","they commit every sin the claim sjws do. but that's ok, cause they're the good guys!"
"6957","well, this takes the fun out of watching thunderf00t mock the people who _actually_ deserve to be mocked."
"6958","i'm glad thunderf00t jumped off the anti sjw bandwagon and mostly just does science videos again. he knows his stuff when it comes to the field that he actually has expertise in. looking back it's pretty embarrassing how much he straw maned and obsessed about anita."
"6959","something i always found ironic and stupid about the hate for anita... she did exactly what the activist end of gaming wanted, treated games with the same critique framework as other media.  show her videos to someone who works in tv, movies, or publishing and they go 'well yeah, this is really old news, why is this significant?', but her detractors seemed to want games to take their rightful place of respect among other media, but somehow not connect to culture in the same way?"
"6960","i personally can't stand her. but she's doing something right if all these ""rationals"" are so upset by her."
"6961","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"6962","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"6963","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"6964","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."
"6965","i haven't seen much of anita and i've only heard of people whining about her but after seeing this she actually seems pretty reasonable"
"6966","middle aged slightly fat man. lol"
"6967","all these videos painting sarkeesian as a rational human being is going to make me going to have to go in and be immaculate in criticism about her.  why won't anyone do criticism of her justice?"
"6968","also, the implication that 'adult' games are immune to social criticism is hilarious."
"6969","thunderf00t is in love with anita sarkeesian and manifests his love like an 8-year-old boy."
"6970","people like thunderf00t give atheism a bad name"
"6971","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."
"6972","what does the sj on his sunglasses stand for?"
"6973","20:45 i don't see why they don't. of course if you have a prejudiced concept about certain roles and how characters filling that role should dress, most likely in a way that suits the direct function of that role, you're seem right.
but you'd then have to explain outfits in any situation where it's not functional"
"6974","reading these comments, its amazing to see how you've influenced people into reconsidering their own thinking. thank you so much for all of your hard work"
"6975","are you doing alright over there?"
"6976","wish i'd found you earlier, shaun."
"6977","i swear to god, these same exact videos were being made 6 years ago. can gamers ever talk about new things?"
"6978","so i thought this guy was smart and i realize now why that is. he is just the like a voice actor for a group who writes the script for him!"
"6979","funderfoot"
"6980","thunderf00t just loves making the same videos multiple times.. anita, solar roadways, water from air, hyperloop, elon musk, ect.."
"6981","thanks for pointing this out, i have been completely uncritical then thunderfoot talked about feminism"
"6982","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"6983","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"6984","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"6985","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"6986","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"6987","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"6988","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"6989","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"6990","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"6991","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."
"6992","wow....im highly disappointed by thunderf00t,  i mean...he is a scientist...."
"6993","yeah, thunderf00ts obsession with anita sarkeesian is why i unsubscribed. i subbed for athiesm talk."
"6994","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.
i'm very glad you made this video, shaun. it's even more eye opening now."
"6995","i love all of thunders science videos where he debunks impossible go fund me campaigns but he doesn't know politics"
"6996","i mean... rek'sai is a chick and she's a weird land shark insect alien. don't that count?"
"6997","thunder wants her bad...."
"6998","i don't like either anita or thunderfoot. .__."
"6999","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"7000","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"7003","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"7004","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"7005","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"7006","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"7007","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."

"7011","cuck cuck cuck, cuckoldy fucking cuck. cuck fell down and cuck turned brown, then cuck called oppression while turning it around. cuck got a stiffy for anita sarkeesian, cuck cums in a jiffy, but something seems iffy, 'coz what cuck doesn't know, is anita sarkeesian's a poe."
"7012","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"7013","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"7014","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"7015","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"7016","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"7022","gauging by the dislike ratio, it seems thunderfoot doesn't have as many fans as, say sargon. interesting how the ratios can fluctuate depending on who your subject is. really makes you think ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh? no not really. keep up the good work sir."

"7025","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."
"7042","back when i was still angry, drinking a lot and watching ppl like tf, sargon etc. i never bothered watching anita's videos or searching for different perspectives that could have altered my view. i already ""knew"" what kind of a person she was so why should i? this was quite a while ago and i never gave that shit much thought again - only recently did i start actually challenging the views i actively held back then: anita is definitely more competent and constructive than the version of her i held some weird, constructed grudge against. thanks for this video, shaun."

or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."
"7050","never tought i'd feel sympathy for her one day... guess antis-sjw bother me more than anita now. time sure changes."
"7051","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"7052","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."
"7053","i really don't get thunderf00t sometimes. his content on science and debunking pseudoscience is interesting and generally quite thoughtful (he does have something against batteries though it seems). 

glad i'm not the only one to noticed his odd anti-sjw stuff. it really doesn't fit with his usually high standards."
"7054","sarkeesian is an idiot. thunderf00t ftw"
"7055","it bothers me way more than it should that this dude say midrift instead of midriff"
"7056","they commit every sin the claim sjws do. but that's ok, cause they're the good guys!"
"7057","well, this takes the fun out of watching thunderf00t mock the people who _actually_ deserve to be mocked."
"7058","i'm glad thunderf00t jumped off the anti sjw bandwagon and mostly just does science videos again. he knows his stuff when it comes to the field that he actually has expertise in. looking back it's pretty embarrassing how much he straw maned and obsessed about anita."
"7059","something i always found ironic and stupid about the hate for anita... she did exactly what the activist end of gaming wanted, treated games with the same critique framework as other media.  show her videos to someone who works in tv, movies, or publishing and they go 'well yeah, this is really old news, why is this significant?', but her detractors seemed to want games to take their rightful place of respect among other media, but somehow not connect to culture in the same way?"
"7060","i personally can't stand her. but she's doing something right if all these ""rationals"" are so upset by her."
"7061","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"7062","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"7063","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"7064","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."
"7065","i haven't seen much of anita and i've only heard of people whining about her but after seeing this she actually seems pretty reasonable"
"7066","middle aged slightly fat man. lol"
"7067","all these videos painting sarkeesian as a rational human being is going to make me going to have to go in and be immaculate in criticism about her.  why won't anyone do criticism of her justice?"
"7068","also, the implication that 'adult' games are immune to social criticism is hilarious."
"7069","thunderf00t is in love with anita sarkeesian and manifests his love like an 8-year-old boy."
"7070","people like thunderf00t give atheism a bad name"
"7071","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."
"7072","what does the sj on his sunglasses stand for?"
"7073","20:45 i don't see why they don't. of course if you have a prejudiced concept about certain roles and how characters filling that role should dress, most likely in a way that suits the direct function of that role, you're seem right.
but you'd then have to explain outfits in any situation where it's not functional"
"7074","reading these comments, its amazing to see how you've influenced people into reconsidering their own thinking. thank you so much for all of your hard work"
"7075","are you doing alright over there?"
"7076","wish i'd found you earlier, shaun."
"7077","i swear to god, these same exact videos were being made 6 years ago. can gamers ever talk about new things?"
"7078","so i thought this guy was smart and i realize now why that is. he is just the like a voice actor for a group who writes the script for him!"
"7079","funderfoot"
"7080","thunderf00t just loves making the same videos multiple times.. anita, solar roadways, water from air, hyperloop, elon musk, ect.."
"7081","thanks for pointing this out, i have been completely uncritical then thunderfoot talked about feminism"
"7082","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"7083","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"7084","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"7085","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"7086","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"7087","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"7088","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"7089","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"7090","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"7091","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."
"7092","wow....im highly disappointed by thunderf00t,  i mean...he is a scientist...."
"7093","yeah, thunderf00ts obsession with anita sarkeesian is why i unsubscribed. i subbed for athiesm talk."
"7094","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.
i'm very glad you made this video, shaun. it's even more eye opening now."
"7095","i love all of thunders science videos where he debunks impossible go fund me campaigns but he doesn't know politics"
"7096","i mean... rek'sai is a chick and she's a weird land shark insect alien. don't that count?"
"7097","thunder wants her bad...."
"7098","i don't like either anita or thunderfoot. .__."
"7099","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"7100","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"7103","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"7104","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"7105","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"7106","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"7107","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."

"7112","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"7113","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"7114","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"7115","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"7116","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"7125","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."
"7142","back when i was still angry, drinking a lot and watching ppl like tf, sargon etc. i never bothered watching anita's videos or searching for different perspectives that could have altered my view. i already ""knew"" what kind of a person she was so why should i? this was quite a while ago and i never gave that shit much thought again - only recently did i start actually challenging the views i actively held back then: anita is definitely more competent and constructive than the version of her i held some weird, constructed grudge against. thanks for this video, shaun."

"7151","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"7152","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."
"7153","i really don't get thunderf00t sometimes. his content on science and debunking pseudoscience is interesting and generally quite thoughtful (he does have something against batteries though it seems).

"7156","they commit every sin the claim sjws do. but that's ok, cause they're the good guys!"
"7157","well, this takes the fun out of watching thunderf00t mock the people who _actually_ deserve to be mocked."
"7158","i'm glad thunderf00t jumped off the anti sjw bandwagon and mostly just does science videos again. he knows his stuff when it comes to the field that he actually has expertise in. looking back it's pretty embarrassing how much he straw maned and obsessed about anita."
"7159","something i always found ironic and stupid about the hate for anita... she did exactly what the activist end of gaming wanted, treated games with the same critique framework as other media.  show her videos to someone who works in tv, movies, or publishing and they go 'well yeah, this is really old news, why is this significant?', but her detractors seemed to want games to take their rightful place of respect among other media, but somehow not connect to culture in the same way?"
"7160","i personally can't stand her. but she's doing something right if all these ""rationals"" are so upset by her."
"7161","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"7162","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"7163","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"7164","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."
"7165","i haven't seen much of anita and i've only heard of people whining about her but after seeing this she actually seems pretty reasonable"
"7166","middle aged slightly fat man. lol"
"7167","all these videos painting sarkeesian as a rational human being is going to make me going to have to go in and be immaculate in criticism about her.  why won't anyone do criticism of her justice?"
"7168","also, the implication that 'adult' games are immune to social criticism is hilarious."
"7169","thunderf00t is in love with anita sarkeesian and manifests his love like an 8-year-old boy."
"7170","people like thunderf00t give atheism a bad name"
"7171","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."
"7172","what does the sj on his sunglasses stand for?"
"7173","20:45 i don't see why they don't. of course if you have a prejudiced concept about certain roles and how characters filling that role should dress, most likely in a way that suits the direct function of that role, you're seem right.
but you'd then have to explain outfits in any situation where it's not functional"
"7174","reading these comments, its amazing to see how you've influenced people into reconsidering their own thinking. thank you so much for all of your hard work"
"7175","are you doing alright over there?"
"7176","wish i'd found you earlier, shaun."
"7177","i swear to god, these same exact videos were being made 6 years ago. can gamers ever talk about new things?"

"7182","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"7183","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"7184","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"7185","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"7186","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"7187","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"7188","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"7189","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"7190","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"7191","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."
"7192","wow....im highly disappointed by thunderf00t,  i mean...he is a scientist...."
"7193","yeah, thunderf00ts obsession with anita sarkeesian is why i unsubscribed. i subbed for athiesm talk."
"7194","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.
i'm very glad you made this video, shaun. it's even more eye opening now."
"7195","i love all of thunders science videos where he debunks impossible go fund me campaigns but he doesn't know politics"

"7199","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"7200","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"7203","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"7204","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"7205","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"7206","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"7207","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."

"7212","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"7213","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"7214","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"7215","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"7216","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"7222","gauging by the dislike ratio, it seems thunderfoot doesn't have as many fans as, say sargon. interesting how the ratios can fluctuate depending on who your subject is. really makes you think ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh? no not really. keep up the good work sir."

"7224","i feel like nobody ever actually defends anita they just attack the people who attack her"
"7225","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

"7241","tf started out doing creationist-busting videos, then moved on to science videos, which is his expert field. he was successful enough at that to come to rely on the income from yt. sadly, to maintain his views, he chose to move into socio-political commentary, and revealed a host of unexamined prejudices and frankly shitty attitudes.

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."
"7242","back when i was still angry, drinking a lot and watching ppl like tf, sargon etc. i never bothered watching anita's videos or searching for different perspectives that could have altered my view. i already ""knew"" what kind of a person she was so why should i? this was quite a while ago and i never gave that shit much thought again - only recently did i start actually challenging the views i actively held back then: anita is definitely more competent and constructive than the version of her i held some weird, constructed grudge against. thanks for this video, shaun."

"7249","17:23 hm, a little something to add here is that, just maybe, a rating does not equal an audience.
lets pick movies as an example: ""the theory of everything"" (the stephen hawkins biographical drama, in case someone does not know) is rated fsk0 (the german rating system for films, the ""usk"" being the same just for games, certifying something as admissible for everyone (fsk0) or people 6 (fsk6), 12 (fsk12) or 18 (fsk18) years and older, a system i am more accustom too and actually find a little better than the american ratings), or going with american ratings pg-13. does that make it a child s move (or even a movie for young teens)? obviously not, it is relatively unlikely that someone at that age already knows anything about the man, let alone cares about his life or his relationship with his wife.
or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."

"7261","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"7262","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"7263","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"7264","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."
"7265","i haven't seen much of anita and i've only heard of people whining about her but after seeing this she actually seems pretty reasonable"
"7266","middle aged slightly fat man. lol"
"7267","all these videos painting sarkeesian as a rational human being is going to make me going to have to go in and be immaculate in criticism about her.  why won't anyone do criticism of her justice?"
"7268","also, the implication that 'adult' games are immune to social criticism is hilarious."
"7269","thunderf00t is in love with anita sarkeesian and manifests his love like an 8-year-old boy."
"7270","people like thunderf00t give atheism a bad name"
"7271","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."
"7272","what does the sj on his sunglasses stand for?"
"7273","20:45 i don't see why they don't. of course if you have a prejudiced concept about certain roles and how characters filling that role should dress, most likely in a way that suits the direct function of that role, you're seem right.
but you'd then have to explain outfits in any situation where it's not functional"
"7274","reading these comments, its amazing to see how you've influenced people into reconsidering their own thinking. thank you so much for all of your hard work"

"7281","thanks for pointing this out, i have been completely uncritical then thunderfoot talked about feminism"
"7282","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"7283","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"7284","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"7285","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"7286","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"7287","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"7288","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"7289","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"7290","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"7291","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."
"7292","wow....im highly disappointed by thunderf00t,  i mean...he is a scientist...."
"7293","yeah, thunderf00ts obsession with anita sarkeesian is why i unsubscribed. i subbed for athiesm talk."
"7294","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.
i'm very glad you made this video, shaun. it's even more eye opening now."
"7295","i love all of thunders science videos where he debunks impossible go fund me campaigns but he doesn't know politics"

"7298","i don't like either anita or thunderfoot. .__."
"7299","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"7300","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"7303","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"7304","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"7305","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"7306","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"7307","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."
"7308","sarkeesean:

"7311","cuck cuck cuck, cuckoldy fucking cuck. cuck fell down and cuck turned brown, then cuck called oppression while turning it around. cuck got a stiffy for anita sarkeesian, cuck cums in a jiffy, but something seems iffy, 'coz what cuck doesn't know, is anita sarkeesian's a poe."
"7312","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"7313","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"7314","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"7315","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"7316","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"7322","gauging by the dislike ratio, it seems thunderfoot doesn't have as many fans as, say sargon. interesting how the ratios can fluctuate depending on who your subject is. really makes you think ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh? no not really. keep up the good work sir."
"7323","when someone labeled ted cruz tells you to ""stick to science"", and some 200 people agree with him.... i actually don't know what that means, it is a highly confusing scenario to be honest."
"7324","i feel like nobody ever actually defends anita they just attack the people who attack her"
"7325","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

"7341","tf started out doing creationist-busting videos, then moved on to science videos, which is his expert field. he was successful enough at that to come to rely on the income from yt. sadly, to maintain his views, he chose to move into socio-political commentary, and revealed a host of unexamined prejudices and frankly shitty attitudes.

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."
"7342","back when i was still angry, drinking a lot and watching ppl like tf, sargon etc. i never bothered watching anita's videos or searching for different perspectives that could have altered my view. i already ""knew"" what kind of a person she was so why should i? this was quite a while ago and i never gave that shit much thought again - only recently did i start actually challenging the views i actively held back then: anita is definitely more competent and constructive than the version of her i held some weird, constructed grudge against. thanks for this video, shaun."
"7343","thunderfoot is a creep..."
"7344","so glad to be out of the anti-sjw echo chamber, just like sjws they find the boogeyman everywhere and its a pretty depressing life."

"7349","17:23 hm, a little something to add here is that, just maybe, a rating does not equal an audience.
lets pick movies as an example: ""the theory of everything"" (the stephen hawkins biographical drama, in case someone does not know) is rated fsk0 (the german rating system for films, the ""usk"" being the same just for games, certifying something as admissible for everyone (fsk0) or people 6 (fsk6), 12 (fsk12) or 18 (fsk18) years and older, a system i am more accustom too and actually find a little better than the american ratings), or going with american ratings pg-13. does that make it a child s move (or even a movie for young teens)? obviously not, it is relatively unlikely that someone at that age already knows anything about the man, let alone cares about his life or his relationship with his wife.
or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."
"7350","never tought i'd feel sympathy for her one day... guess antis-sjw bother me more than anita now. time sure changes."
"7351","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"7352","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."

"7371","what i find interesting about this whole 'anita thinks that women's depiction as being sex objects is problematic' in video games issue? what happens when you decide to make a game which is pretty explicitly about sexualization of women, because it's a game that inevitably involves sex between characters? basically what is going to be the problem here is that you'll be telling men that what they find sexually attractive is now a societal issue.

now forgive me but, doesn't that sound entitled to you?

and don't you think that there will be almost no apologies at all for women who say they're into muscled men, fucking beefcakes, jocks, assholes, etc, their own personal taste? because that wouldn't be a problem for women, surely, it's no-one's problem for having sexual preferences.

where else could you go from here?

but this is a total deviation from the point that i just thought would make for interesting perusal. i concede that anita wants more diversity in female characterization. though, i can't say that her suggesting that in the end it doesn't even matter whether jade fits the typical female model of attractiveness helps her case. she makes it out to seem like a petty issue, accusing league of legends developers of being incapable of making different female characters - and then when we get to jade, we learn well as long as the individuals personality and motivations are different and interesting, that they're more acceptable.

i don't really know the backstory of most league of legend characters, though, but i do know that they actually exist (surprisingly). that's all characters, though. most are probably not that compelled to read them if they're just playing league for the game. the most strikingly diverse female character that comes to mind is anivia. who is basically a bird. there is also a robotic female, though admittedly in a humanoid, pretty average female form. and not all of the female characters are made to be amazingly attractive.

the most important part of attraction i assume is intimacy. you know, not that i'd personally say so, but intimacy, that's something a lot of people want."

"7382","i've had to unsubscribe from thunderf00t, due to his blatant sexism. it's a shame, that such a smart guy could be so stupid."
"7383","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"7384","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."
"7385","thanks so much for making this video - you made me realize i'd been taking thunderf00t's warped view of anita as the real picture of her. now i know better"
"7386","actually, thunderf00t can be really fun to watch...if you catch one of his pure science videos. the cynical abrasive person disappears in the face of wonder and joy at sharing the marvels of things like making electrons visible to the naked eye or putting a camera in a neutron beam."
"7387","thunderf00t is an interesting one, he actually does nice videos on science and is good at debunking stuff but when it comes to politics he is just off the charts in every direction"
"7388","*sigh......
my gosh.....perhaps i should've watched sarkeesian's videos before being dragged to the pits of anti-feminist hell, by youtubers such as thunderf00t."
"7389","yea he's got a thing for her. a lot them do."
"7390","but she is wrong about dota 2: medusa and broothmother and legion commander"
"7391","i liked his videos where he would debunk stupid kickstarter products, but he was clearly doing the political stuff for views and shit. i stopped watching him a bit ago, because if i watched his good videos i would get a ton of anti feminist videos despite me not watching his anti feminist videos because i found them boring and really uneventful."

"7394","i watched a few of his videos but soon got that weird feeling of ""what the hell is up with this guy's obsession with that lady"". it was creepy as you said it.
good thing i didn't continue. he presents her as this evil retarded person, but if you see the other side you'll notice she's really not that bad.

"7399","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"7400","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"7403","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"7404","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"7405","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"7406","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"7407","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."

"7412","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"7413","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"7414","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"7415","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"7416","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"7422","gauging by the dislike ratio, it seems thunderfoot doesn't have as many fans as, say sargon. interesting how the ratios can fluctuate depending on who your subject is. really makes you think ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh? no not really. keep up the good work sir."
"7423","when someone labeled ted cruz tells you to ""stick to science"", and some 200 people agree with him.... i actually don't know what that means, it is a highly confusing scenario to be honest."
"7424","i feel like nobody ever actually defends anita they just attack the people who attack her"
"7425","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

"7441","tf started out doing creationist-busting videos, then moved on to science videos, which is his expert field. he was successful enough at that to come to rely on the income from yt. sadly, to maintain his views, he chose to move into socio-political commentary, and revealed a host of unexamined prejudices and frankly shitty attitudes.

the problem is not that he's talking off his expert field per se; it's that he's a scientist and knows better than to indulge  intellectual dishonesty in pushing a political view. he knows better, and he does it anyway. i liked his early stuff, because he was trying to educate people honestly. he stopped doing that long ago, and went over to the other side."
"7442","back when i was still angry, drinking a lot and watching ppl like tf, sargon etc. i never bothered watching anita's videos or searching for different perspectives that could have altered my view. i already ""knew"" what kind of a person she was so why should i? this was quite a while ago and i never gave that shit much thought again - only recently did i start actually challenging the views i actively held back then: anita is definitely more competent and constructive than the version of her i held some weird, constructed grudge against. thanks for this video, shaun."

"7444","so glad to be out of the anti-sjw echo chamber, just like sjws they find the boogeyman everywhere and its a pretty depressing life."

"7449","17:23 hm, a little something to add here is that, just maybe, a rating does not equal an audience.
lets pick movies as an example: ""the theory of everything"" (the stephen hawkins biographical drama, in case someone does not know) is rated fsk0 (the german rating system for films, the ""usk"" being the same just for games, certifying something as admissible for everyone (fsk0) or people 6 (fsk6), 12 (fsk12) or 18 (fsk18) years and older, a system i am more accustom too and actually find a little better than the american ratings), or going with american ratings pg-13. does that make it a child s move (or even a movie for young teens)? obviously not, it is relatively unlikely that someone at that age already knows anything about the man, let alone cares about his life or his relationship with his wife.
or, given only that picture there let us talk about portal (""usk12"" or ""teen""). i find it reasonable to suggest that the average teen (12-16/18) would neither have a really high interest in a puzzling-game nor would they really appreciate what is a core aspect of the game (the humor). now, of course, there are exceptions to that generalization (i gotta know best since i kind of am such an exception, but i was already relatively deep into video games at the time and the age of 11/12, so i might not really count as ""average""), but i would suggest the average portal player is somwhere around 20 years old.
in general tho: that is a very misleading interpretation of ratings.

the one thing i would be angry about here is the equalization of mobile games and pc/console games, since at least in my book there are just too many reasons and limitations that would prevent mobile to become the platform of any modern core game in the foreseeable future, and presenting neat means to skip some time like angry birds or tiny wings or even plants vs zombies (originally a mobile game, may i remind you), of which at least two turned into complete cash-grabs to gems like machinarium (which was released to mobile too later on, but simply does not feel the same on a screen that goddam small) and partygames like mariokart simply does not work imo.
then again i am a huge fan of the pokemon-games, and there could be an argument that mobile games might become the evolution of handheld devices and games, but i just don´t see that yet."
"7450","never tought i'd feel sympathy for her one day... guess antis-sjw bother me more than anita now. time sure changes."
"7451","i think thunder is too eager to jump the gun even when he makes a good video. his video ""x-prize gives 1.5 million dollar stupidity prize!"" sums it up. he champions science but a key part of science is experimentation, and he is so eager to mock ""turn water vapor into drinking water"" scammers that he thinks ""x-prize funding an experiment"" is the same as ""x-prize funding a scammer"""
"7452","watch a video by anita sarkesian, watch a response video to it, watch a response to said video."
"7453","i really don't get thunderf00t sometimes. his content on science and debunking pseudoscience is interesting and generally quite thoughtful (he does have something against batteries though it seems). 

glad i'm not the only one to noticed his odd anti-sjw stuff. it really doesn't fit with his usually high standards."

"7456","they commit every sin the claim sjws do. but that's ok, cause they're the good guys!"

"7458","i'm glad thunderf00t jumped off the anti sjw bandwagon and mostly just does science videos again. he knows his stuff when it comes to the field that he actually has expertise in. looking back it's pretty embarrassing how much he straw maned and obsessed about anita."
"7459","something i always found ironic and stupid about the hate for anita... she did exactly what the activist end of gaming wanted, treated games with the same critique framework as other media.  show her videos to someone who works in tv, movies, or publishing and they go 'well yeah, this is really old news, why is this significant?', but her detractors seemed to want games to take their rightful place of respect among other media, but somehow not connect to culture in the same way?"
"7460","i personally can't stand her. but she's doing something right if all these ""rationals"" are so upset by her."
"7461","i enjoy his kickstarter scam debunks where he knows his stuff - i've genuinely learned a lot from watching them in the same way i've learned a lot from watching shaun's videos (common deception tactics, some basic rules that allow you to identify fraud inventions more easily, and a variety of important scientific principles, etc) - as well as his live debates where he actually comes across very polite and respectful. it was always pretty obvious to me i couldn't take his videos on topics he ""hates"" seriously, so i steered clear of them by a wide mile. despite his hypocrisy, i wish the commentors wouldn't discredit the fact that he has a lot of legitimately well-made and educational content; there's a reason he's been focusing pretty much exclusively on science for the past two years, and i hope it stays that way."
"7462","thank you for the video, shaun.  i had wondered about his obsession with anita but didn't really care enough to look in to it. this help reveal some of his obsessed diversion from the more interesting science videos and taunting of religious types. this is why i haven't watched his channel for a while."
"7463","hmm,weird how his channel has now completely different content"
"7464","jesus i feel ashamed. i never looked into anita sarkeesian because of the negative things i heard about her but after watching a few of her clips in context, she seems like the type of media critic we need more of. i love a lot of what she had to say because they're thoughts i had too and she's not expressing them in a radical, obnoxious way."

"7483","i invite everyone to the great mei-fanclub! <3"
"7484","anita's points are so bloody obvious it makes me shudder to think how the internet would react to someone actually pushing boundaries. no disrespect to anita, it's just her videos are very much entry level feminism and rather mild, even if i don't agree with all her comments."

"7499","8:05 you can tell hes edited it by the audio and mouth movements nit adding up. that ciuld be shauns work, but if its thunderfoots, then thats hella blatant."
"7500","i watched this video last night and it was odd for me to see you talking about thunderfoot's obsession with anita sarkeesian, particularly when you were saying he had a file on her with all her screen appearances etc. well i know you were more inferring that from his rather meticulous cherry picking, but the whole thing reminded me so much of the man who almost certainly has a  number of files with complex subsections about me. i once developed the theory that he had some app on his phone where he specifically stored all my sarcastic comments about him and had varying ratings for them depending on how funny they were and how searing they were, and probably has categories like, ""when she says i'm a misogynist {eye roll emoji}""  and ""man does she go on about my so called ""ego"""" and i really would not be surprised to find he really does that. 

this started back in 2012 and back then it was all very difficult and upsetting, and extremely confusing, especially as i had met him as a result of trying to get away from a situation where i was the subject of a massive bullying campaign orchestrated by a woman i had known for years, and subsequently realised i had been gangstalked, a word not much in use back then. i haven't done facebook for years because of that. facebook's obsession with connecting you with people to the point where it kind of makes you stalk people by default is really bad if you want to avoid people. it's also the reason i don't use my real name on social media platforms. it seemed like i had some way of always finding the worst people to be around. these days i'm used to dealing with it, and since then there has been gamergate and #metoo and stories of bullying and harassment in all sorts of places including the houses of parliament, and i've realised my experience is actually not as uncommon as i had thought, and it's not just some weird way i have of finding the places where bullying happens, because it happens in most places. it's oddly reassuring to know this isn't just me, and the man who has pretty much had this attitude like thunderfoot of doing everything he can to get my attention bar pulling my hair is definitely not the only overgrown schoolboy unable to deal with how he feels about a woman. i've been lucky  he hasn't used his own fairly big youtube platform to make some shitty video like that about me, but that isn't really anything to do with him being nice. he's told lies about me and cherry picked like thunderfoot to misrepresent me to everyone around him in his real life for years. it's mainly strategic, part of his continual gaslighting thing, plus it would ruin the nice guy image he likes to keep up. it has meant that by default i've ended up getting my own narrative out there in public before he has, which wasn't exactly something i intended, but does make it more difficult for him if wants to try it. 

my experiences have seemed so surreal, and i have felt a lot of the time like i have been stuck in some computer game with no end, always another level to complete, but watching videos like this, it kind of makes it more real, more believable to me, which is better, believe it or not. i had a conversation with a homeless man today and we were talking about the ways that authorities bear down on people like us, tell lies to suit them and get away with it all the time, and it was nice to be able to have that conversation where we could say this shit was real and not have to worry about it not being believable. people really do the most ridiculous and obviously appalling things and they always have, it's only now it's being acknowledged."

"7503","i'll be damned this is the first time i've really listened to anita's points and the ones you showed were pretty damn reasonable. really goes to show how good these creeps have been at structuring the narrative that i was expecting her to be an inarticulate nutcase and her videos to be contradictory nonsense. it seems that's far from the truth."
"7504","i wonder if content creators like thunderfoot think about their videos with people like shaun on the site. now a days your gonna be called out on your bs in do time. i enjoy this kind of material. thank you for doing this."
"7505","how did i miss this video? i made a point of watching anita's  first slate of videos because the vitriol coming of some of the people i actually followed was just overwhelming, and by the end of the fist ""tropes"" video, it was painfully obvious that there was an overt misogyny at work, many times with a not-so-subtle element of violence. i unfollowed several people on here and twitter after that. as their opinions, as with thunderfoot's highlighted here, were not only incorrect and irrational, but frankly idiotic, hateful and again, possessed of violent undertones."
"7506","cherrypicker vs human garbage which ironically contributed a lot for trump to win elections by representing leftist as cringy dirty crying masturbators. if you ""understand"" anita, you are stupid person, because she doesn't believe and have any ideals, she is just an actor. her words are just like words of a liar - non worthy and dangerously misleading."
"7507","shaun, i've been listening to a few of your videos in the background while i game for the last week or two, and i have to say, thank you. your videos have made me take a more critical eye (something i would usually pride myself on, but apparently had fallen into selectively imposing) towards those whose content i used to regularly consume and whose presentation of information i used to base quite a number of my opinions on. i'd fallen out of interest with people like sargon  a while ago when i started noticing how incredibly hyperbolic and lazy he had become (and maybe always had been) but i never really thought i'd find myself being so profoundly disappointed in someone like thunderf00t, let alone feeling somewhat endeared to anita freaking sarkeesian. i still disagree with her on more issues than i agree, but you're the first person i've ever watched who has shown that ""everthing is x"" clip in its full context. thank you for shattering my echochamber and presenting me with uncomfortable and unfamiliar ideas."

"7512","shaun you've sort of changed my opinion of anita. i've never really found value in any of the clips i've seen of her so i never looked into deeper context of what she was saying but it seems like thunderfoot is far from the only person to take her out of context."
"7513","when thunderf00t talks, he sounds like a jabbering pair of soggy lips attached directly to the anita-hating hivemind."
"7514","""talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you have to hate it""

good lord, if there was one thing i wish i could instill in those gamergate knuckleheads it would be that.  for some reason there is this absolute monster backlash from the altier rightier ""gamer"" crowd where they react to any form of criticism as if it is equivalent to hating a game or refusing to buy it or demanding it not be sold or however far they want to go in their crazy strawman.  critique, including feminist critique, doesn't in any way imply that the story of whatever you are dealing with is abhorrent, it means it could be better.  every single feminist i have ever met in my life, including myself, enjoys more than a few problematic stories.  sometimes deeply problematic stories.

there is no reason for the chicken little routine when something you like is critiqued!  good things can be critiqued!  you can enjoy things that get elements of their design wrong!  why is this so incomprehensible to some people?"
"7515","i owe anita sarkesian an apology. i never really followed thunderf00t's anti-feminism but i thought he was above such obvious quote mining. thanks for pointing it out."
"7516","sorry for being late to the party.  this video is two-years-old and the last original comment appears to be from a year ago; my bad for not stumbling across your channel until now.  i was a big fan of thunderf00t many years ago, and found his series ""why do people laugh at creationists"" very funny, especially when it came to his dealings with venomfangx and nephilimfree specifically.  from there, i started watching the likes of dprjones (who doesn't seem to be too active anymore) and aron ra (still one of my favorites).  still, thunderf00t was one of my first discoveries in the youtuber community (if that's what you'd call it...i think), and those ""...creationists"" videos actually helped me through a really tough time in my life, as i was going through a lot of inner turmoil over feeling like the religion i was brought up in was kind of bullshit (i'm feeling much better now).  i think i was on board with thunderf00t from the fist wdplac video, 11 years ago, until somewhere close to episode 35 in 2011 when i could no longer listen to him at work.  

why am i putting all of this out there?  well, because i really, really liked him.  i liked what he had to say, because it made sense to me.  when he was making fun of these creationist zealots, it really fit in with how i was feeling at the time, but there was a hint of absolutism to what he was saying; that everyone who was religious at all, in his mind, was some sort of extremist (my interpretation).  i kind of stopped watching him after he started burning hard drives that were full of copies of the quran, just to see if that got around the whole ""it's bad to burn a quran"" thing.  i had only seen one of his videos on anita sarkeesian, and since i was sort of inclined to agree with him at the time, i was like, ""well, she seems sort of unreasonable,"" and kind of left it at that.  i didn't watch any of her content, and didn't regard anything i'd seen of her in the news media with any sort of interest.  

after watching your video here, though, i'm starting to feel like the video i'd seen so many years ago was edited specifically to manipulate and create a false narrative of what she was actually saying.  now, i'm not going to apply that feeling to the wdplac videos because, well, you don't really have to cherrypick that stuff to make it look crazy, but it was a bummer to see a demonstration of how a person that i liked and kind of respected, in as much as i could from one youtube series, would stoop to the level of using the same tactics he lambasted when someone else did it.  maybe on a  subconscious level i could detect what he was doing and that's why i stopped watching...i don't know.  i knew that his videos on muslims weren't being fair to all muslims, and his actions did seem a bit extreme to me, even then...i don't know.  thanks for giving me the opportunity for some self-reflection this morning, if you've managed to read this far."

"7525","i still have to agree with thunderf00t about anita's desire to infantilize video gaming. you were only able to provide 1 example of a game she criticized that wasn't m/m-equivalent rated. feminists are basically children, and no amount of technicality will change that."

"7539","i have  issues with feminism (the same issues i have with lgbt movement) in that there are loud minorities in it that need to be kicked out. ( not caring about womens issues outside of the west...ie western centric feminism. misandrists, terfs, anti-bisexuals, transphobes ect.) or at least called the fuck out. because when you  affect change that legally redefines rape to the exclusion of men and female abusers, i have a real problem with you. that said, sargon is absolutely full of shit. this entire thing is him going ""reeeeeeeeee"" over the fact that in this instance it really is a feminist issue. women and girls aren't being properly diagnosed with mental health issues due to the way females uniquely present. (i suspect due to those annoying gender roles and expectations)  which is hurting them...i don't get why...that's such a bad thing..?  ""do you want more autistic people!!!!!!!!!?????"" uh no...we want a better way to diagnose women with mental health issues, especially autism because, and this might shock you, male and female brains are wired  differently and respond differently to stimuli. weird..for someone who goes on and on about criticle thinking and skepticism...he doesn't do much of being either non?"
"7540","now, i don't have concrete numbers to prove it, so someone correct me, if i'm wrong, but .. health care spending  _cannot ever_ be equal in amount for men and women, unless pregnancy becomes available for men, which i doubt will ever happen. 
starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."
"7541","alt right comment section gave me aids"
"7542","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"7549","""feminist system"" tell that to your president"
"7550","i hate men that speak that way about feminists, its just gross and its amusing they don't see that.  i be they have rape fantasy"
"7551","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

"7575","5 sargon long"
"7576","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"7577","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"7578","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"7579","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."

"7581","anyone notice that those are all autistic stereotypes he's using and no actually diagnosing material? when i was diagnosed with autism the main signs in my case was speech development, delays, taking metaphors literally or just not understanding them properly, my ultra sensitive ears which caused me a lot of pain. i did have meltdowns as a kid but that can be a ton of different things from bipolar to psychosis to extreme anxiety(panic attacks) so it wasn't exactly the main qualifier for autism. and who tf is sauron calling unempathetic! that was disproven before sauron was born in the 60's. actually, data now shows that a lot of us are more empathetic than most people towards animals and are more likely to have a close connection with them. the reason we don't always act the same towards humans is that many of them treat us poorly and we're seen as unempathetic when say our peers who bullied us are getting their just desserts. and honestly, would you feel bad if someone who tried to make you feel like dirt fell down and scraped their knee? how many of you would be empathetic towards sauron is he got a family member diagnosed with a disability after seeing this video? towards the kid for having such a shitty relative definitely. for sauron now realizing what its like to have a family member who is treated like dirt and there is truly nothing, the kid can do to stop it? or if one of the kids bullying his relative did it because they watch alt right wing youtube and disabled people must be kept down so the majority can survive? jesus christ dude if those were the categories for autism i'm pretty sure it would be alt-righters and anti sjw that ended up branded with it"

"7589","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

"7597","right so i'm very late and this is kind of only tangentially related but it was getting on my nerves
i have adhd (which is the same kind of disorder as autism and tends to manifest in a lot of similar ways) and ""extreme sensitivity to criticism"" is like. not what sargon thinks it is? it's present in adhd and a lot of other disorders and sometimes called rejection-sensitive dysphoria or rsd--dysphoria basically meaning to feel bad. because that's literally what that is. it's ""someone criticized me a bit and now i'm having a panic attack"" not ""someone has a different opinion so i blocked them on twitter"" or ""i blocked someone on twitter for throwing around ableist slurs"". the ""extreme sensitivity"" is feeling like someone *hates* you or a thing you made because they said something slightly critical, not, like, getting upset at people who defend racists. where i'm from, getting mad at someone who is extremely condescending and advocates for your murder because of your opinions (despite not knowing what your opinions are) is called being a person.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off.

starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."

"7642","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"7651","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

"7676","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"7677","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"7678","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"7679","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."

"7689","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

"7700","let me first say, i love long videos, and i like hearing viewpoints different to mine. i even agree with a few from sargon. but he can go fuck himself with a cactus for stooping down to using autism, something i (and many others)struggle with, even with my own family members, and i'm almost 30, as an insult against radical people he dislikes. i usually don't just degrade myself into hurling insults, but fucking hell... one thing is being derogatory towards radicals, another is equating them with a disorder that isn't one's fault, and often has real, sometimes very severe, consequences. and it's used as an insult to call some retarded or stupid or whatever else it could stand in for. that is fucking scummy.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off. 

blegh, sorry for the outburst, but felt i had to say it."
"7701","i've only listened to the original dude's first ""point"" and i'm sickened. as a feminist i'm offended. as the aunt of an autistic child i'm offended. hell, as a human being i'm offended."
"7702","as a person with asperger's, or autism spectrum disorder as they call it now, that list that sargon uses is flat out wrong for some points. especially lack of empathy. i have never met another autistic person in my life who couldn't have empathy. the thing is, is that some of us (not even all of us) have a hard time expressing feelings of empathy. but just because we don't always outwardly express our feelings of empathy, doesn't mean we don't have it. i've even heard other people argue that autistic people have more empathy, but i'm not really gonna argue that point because i don't have a way of actually confirming if that is true."

"7712","nao"
"7713","i'm autistic and comparing me to sargon is insulting"
"7714","i had a hunch that sargon's banter is correlated to nixon's southern strategy: cherrypicking radical outliers, abstracting words, and proclaiming he's right to his audience."
"7715","i'd have thought sargon would have very little experience of recognising when a sexual encounter is being initiated."
"7716","it makes me sad to think that there was a time when i would've liked sargon's video."
"7717","a few years ago, autistics were all over youtube, talking about their condition, educating people, having conversations with each other, sharing information about the condition and comparing notes. it looked like people were really getting smarter about the true nature of autisms in it's many diverse forms. and now? idiots are just using the word to insult everybody they don't like. man have we slipped backward.
   anyway, we know that sargon isn't autistic. he isn't smart enough."
"7718","so with his logic the reason islamic extremists commit terrorism is because their society gives them no other choices."
"7719","shit! carl went full alex jones at the end there."
"7720","to think that you could look up a list of indicators that someone might have autism and then use those indicators to diagnose anyone with autism, proves you know nothing about it. autism isn't just a ""if you do these things then you have it"" type of deal. it's way bigger than that. someone could (and probably does) have autism and not exhibit any of the ""indicators"" that he listed in his video."
"7721","i like the ending."
"7722","portraying rape as a ""last resort"" and saying it's women's/feminist's fault....the complete lack of awareness and the unwillingness to examine the social and societal level of this is...astounding, but not actually surprising, considering the kind of person sargon is."

"7724","so intellectually dishonest... ugh"
"7725","lmao, what is this guy smoking!? i do not have a tumbler account and not a feminist; although i sympathize with them. 
i kind of agree with sargon that i tend to not pick up ques with women unless if they were verbal; however that is more a sexual preference. i prefer women that are happy in the relationship and prefer not to get into a relationship willy-nilly. if i get into a relationship willy-nilly, i run the risk of creeping the woman out and they lose their sexual appeal; due to fear and anger.
fear and anger is not sexy."
"7726","i actually am autistic and i don't recall ""not taking criticism well"" being a sign. but this is quoting an article that, from what was shown, was written by someone who isn't a doctor or has any training in any form of relevant medicine and her only connection seems to be she's convinced her husband is autistic. so not exactly medically accurate information he's quoting."
"7727","you fuck, you just exposed me to leafyishere i've got 15 kinds of cancer now"
"7728","jebus, i knew enough about sargon to know that he was an absolute moron enamored with appearing intelligent to similarly unintelligent people, but i wasn't expecting that degree of vitriolic hate - i'd only ever heard him kind of indignantly and sarcastically drone on, but that was like... like molyneux levels of pathetic hatred. kind of feel bad for him now..."
"7729","23:40 onward is everything you need to ever know about sargon"

"7732","i have absolutely no clue why these people are using ""autistic"" as an insult. i have high-functioning autism, and it has actually given me advantages as a working musician and artist. one of the most common symptoms of autism is hyper-focusing, and that's a great skill to have in the workplace."
"7733","i'm autistic and i'm tired of having to coexist with such decrepit mongrels!lol"
"7734","i love that sargon's complete inability to see autism as anything but a buzzword makes him not even realize why we do studies on different rates of diagnosis or why underdiagnosis of a condition is a problem at all (a hint: it's because autistic folks are *gasp* people! and ones who might need additional support especially when growing up! and going undiagnosed for a developmental disorder can majorly fuck with your self esteem! what a surprise!)"

"7738","sargon isn't very epic."
"7739","i have  issues with feminism (the same issues i have with lgbt movement) in that there are loud minorities in it that need to be kicked out. ( not caring about womens issues outside of the west...ie western centric feminism. misandrists, terfs, anti-bisexuals, transphobes ect.) or at least called the fuck out. because when you  affect change that legally redefines rape to the exclusion of men and female abusers, i have a real problem with you. that said, sargon is absolutely full of shit. this entire thing is him going ""reeeeeeeeee"" over the fact that in this instance it really is a feminist issue. women and girls aren't being properly diagnosed with mental health issues due to the way females uniquely present. (i suspect due to those annoying gender roles and expectations)  which is hurting them...i don't get why...that's such a bad thing..?  ""do you want more autistic people!!!!!!!!!?????"" uh no...we want a better way to diagnose women with mental health issues, especially autism because, and this might shock you, male and female brains are wired  differently and respond differently to stimuli. weird..for someone who goes on and on about criticle thinking and skepticism...he doesn't do much of being either non?"
"7740","now, i don't have concrete numbers to prove it, so someone correct me, if i'm wrong, but .. health care spending  _cannot ever_ be equal in amount for men and women, unless pregnancy becomes available for men, which i doubt will ever happen. 
starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."
"7741","alt right comment section gave me aids"
"7742","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"7750","i hate men that speak that way about feminists, its just gross and its amusing they don't see that.  i be they have rape fantasy"
"7751","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

honestly for saying something like this if i ever see you in person, i am clocking you right in the face!

"7776","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"7777","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"7778","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"7779","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."
"7780","sargon was very disrespectful to autists."
"7781","anyone notice that those are all autistic stereotypes he's using and no actually diagnosing material? when i was diagnosed with autism the main signs in my case was speech development, delays, taking metaphors literally or just not understanding them properly, my ultra sensitive ears which caused me a lot of pain. i did have meltdowns as a kid but that can be a ton of different things from bipolar to psychosis to extreme anxiety(panic attacks) so it wasn't exactly the main qualifier for autism. and who tf is sauron calling unempathetic! that was disproven before sauron was born in the 60's. actually, data now shows that a lot of us are more empathetic than most people towards animals and are more likely to have a close connection with them. the reason we don't always act the same towards humans is that many of them treat us poorly and we're seen as unempathetic when say our peers who bullied us are getting their just desserts. and honestly, would you feel bad if someone who tried to make you feel like dirt fell down and scraped their knee? how many of you would be empathetic towards sauron is he got a family member diagnosed with a disability after seeing this video? towards the kid for having such a shitty relative definitely. for sauron now realizing what its like to have a family member who is treated like dirt and there is truly nothing, the kid can do to stop it? or if one of the kids bullying his relative did it because they watch alt right wing youtube and disabled people must be kept down so the majority can survive? jesus christ dude if those were the categories for autism i'm pretty sure it would be alt-righters and anti sjw that ended up branded with it"

"7789","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

"7796","interesting analysis. i think a big problem is the term ""feminism"" / ""feminist"" (same thing with the opposite, but for different reasons). there's a big problem with a preconceived notion of an idea of ""i'm a feminist, that means i only give a shit about female issues."" and in some cases that's true, but in a lot of other cases it's not. i want everyone to be awesome and care about everyone having a good outcome. i say i'm a humanist instead. i care about everyone, and no one can object to that. well i guess except for some religious people but oh well."
"7797","right so i'm very late and this is kind of only tangentially related but it was getting on my nerves
i have adhd (which is the same kind of disorder as autism and tends to manifest in a lot of similar ways) and ""extreme sensitivity to criticism"" is like. not what sargon thinks it is? it's present in adhd and a lot of other disorders and sometimes called rejection-sensitive dysphoria or rsd--dysphoria basically meaning to feel bad. because that's literally what that is. it's ""someone criticized me a bit and now i'm having a panic attack"" not ""someone has a different opinion so i blocked them on twitter"" or ""i blocked someone on twitter for throwing around ableist slurs"". the ""extreme sensitivity"" is feeling like someone *hates* you or a thing you made because they said something slightly critical, not, like, getting upset at people who defend racists. where i'm from, getting mad at someone who is extremely condescending and advocates for your murder because of your opinions (despite not knowing what your opinions are) is called being a person. 


also sargon linking to autism speaks after that™ is disgusting and proves empirically that he doesn't give two shits and a slice of cake about autistic people. anyone who knows any autistic people (cough cough like i do) knows autism speaks is notorious in that community for being hot ableist garbage"

"7800","let me first say, i love long videos, and i like hearing viewpoints different to mine. i even agree with a few from sargon. but he can go fuck himself with a cactus for stooping down to using autism, something i (and many others)struggle with, even with my own family members, and i'm almost 30, as an insult against radical people he dislikes. i usually don't just degrade myself into hurling insults, but fucking hell... one thing is being derogatory towards radicals, another is equating them with a disorder that isn't one's fault, and often has real, sometimes very severe, consequences. and it's used as an insult to call some retarded or stupid or whatever else it could stand in for. that is fucking scummy.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off.

(i suspect due to those annoying gender roles and expectations)  which is hurting them...i don't get why...that's such a bad thing..?  ""do you want more autistic people!!!!!!!!!?????"" uh no...we want a better way to diagnose women with mental health issues, especially autism because, and this might shock you, male and female brains are wired  differently and respond differently to stimuli. weird..for someone who goes on and on about criticle thinking and skepticism...he doesn't do much of being either non?"
"7840","now, i don't have concrete numbers to prove it, so someone correct me, if i'm wrong, but .. health care spending  _cannot ever_ be equal in amount for men and women, unless pregnancy becomes available for men, which i doubt will ever happen. 
starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."
"7841","alt right comment section gave me aids"
"7842","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"7851","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

"7876","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"7877","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"7878","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"7879","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."
"7880","sargon was very disrespectful to autists."
"7881","anyone notice that those are all autistic stereotypes he's using and no actually diagnosing material? when i was diagnosed with autism the main signs in my case was speech development, delays, taking metaphors literally or just not understanding them properly, my ultra sensitive ears which caused me a lot of pain. i did have meltdowns as a kid but that can be a ton of different things from bipolar to psychosis to extreme anxiety(panic attacks) so it wasn't exactly the main qualifier for autism. and who tf is sauron calling unempathetic! that was disproven before sauron was born in the 60's. actually, data now shows that a lot of us are more empathetic than most people towards animals and are more likely to have a close connection with them. the reason we don't always act the same towards humans is that many of them treat us poorly and we're seen as unempathetic when say our peers who bullied us are getting their just desserts. and honestly, would you feel bad if someone who tried to make you feel like dirt fell down and scraped their knee? how many of you would be empathetic towards sauron is he got a family member diagnosed with a disability after seeing this video? towards the kid for having such a shitty relative definitely. for sauron now realizing what its like to have a family member who is treated like dirt and there is truly nothing, the kid can do to stop it? or if one of the kids bullying his relative did it because they watch alt right wing youtube and disabled people must be kept down so the majority can survive? jesus christ dude if those were the categories for autism i'm pretty sure it would be alt-righters and anti sjw that ended up branded with it"

"7889","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

"7896","interesting analysis. i think a big problem is the term ""feminism"" / ""feminist"" (same thing with the opposite, but for different reasons). there's a big problem with a preconceived notion of an idea of ""i'm a feminist, that means i only give a shit about female issues."" and in some cases that's true, but in a lot of other cases it's not. i want everyone to be awesome and care about everyone having a good outcome. i say i'm a humanist instead. i care about everyone, and no one can object to that. well i guess except for some religious people but oh well."
"7897","right so i'm very late and this is kind of only tangentially related but it was getting on my nerves
i have adhd (which is the same kind of disorder as autism and tends to manifest in a lot of similar ways) and ""extreme sensitivity to criticism"" is like. not what sargon thinks it is? it's present in adhd and a lot of other disorders and sometimes called rejection-sensitive dysphoria or rsd--dysphoria basically meaning to feel bad. because that's literally what that is. it's ""someone criticized me a bit and now i'm having a panic attack"" not ""someone has a different opinion so i blocked them on twitter"" or ""i blocked someone on twitter for throwing around ableist slurs"". the ""extreme sensitivity"" is feeling like someone *hates* you or a thing you made because they said something slightly critical, not, like, getting upset at people who defend racists. where i'm from, getting mad at someone who is extremely condescending and advocates for your murder because of your opinions (despite not knowing what your opinions are) is called being a person. 


also sargon linking to autism speaks after that™ is disgusting and proves empirically that he doesn't give two shits and a slice of cake about autistic people. anyone who knows any autistic people (cough cough like i do) knows autism speaks is notorious in that community for being hot ableist garbage"

"7900","let me first say, i love long videos, and i like hearing viewpoints different to mine. i even agree with a few from sargon. but he can go fuck himself with a cactus for stooping down to using autism, something i (and many others)struggle with, even with my own family members, and i'm almost 30, as an insult against radical people he dislikes. i usually don't just degrade myself into hurling insults, but fucking hell... one thing is being derogatory towards radicals, another is equating them with a disorder that isn't one's fault, and often has real, sometimes very severe, consequences. and it's used as an insult to call some retarded or stupid or whatever else it could stand in for. that is fucking scummy.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off.

"7939","i have  issues with feminism (the same issues i have with lgbt movement) in that there are loud minorities in it that need to be kicked out. ( not caring about womens issues outside of the west...ie western centric feminism. misandrists, terfs, anti-bisexuals, transphobes ect.) or at least called the fuck out. because when you  affect change that legally redefines rape to the exclusion of men and female abusers, i have a real problem with you. that said, sargon is absolutely full of shit. this entire thing is him going ""reeeeeeeeee"" over the fact that in this instance it really is a feminist issue. women and girls aren't being properly diagnosed with mental health issues due to the way females uniquely present. (i suspect due to those annoying gender roles and expectations)  which is hurting them...i don't get why...that's such a bad thing..?  ""do you want more autistic people!!!!!!!!!?????"" uh no...we want a better way to diagnose women with mental health issues, especially autism because, and this might shock you, male and female brains are wired  differently and respond differently to stimuli. weird..for someone who goes on and on about criticle thinking and skepticism...he doesn't do much of being either non?"
"7940","now, i don't have concrete numbers to prove it, so someone correct me, if i'm wrong, but .. health care spending  _cannot ever_ be equal in amount for men and women, unless pregnancy becomes available for men, which i doubt will ever happen. 
starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."
"7941","alt right comment section gave me aids"
"7942","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"7951","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

"7976","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"7977","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"7978","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"7979","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."

"7981","anyone notice that those are all autistic stereotypes he's using and no actually diagnosing material? when i was diagnosed with autism the main signs in my case was speech development, delays, taking metaphors literally or just not understanding them properly, my ultra sensitive ears which caused me a lot of pain. i did have meltdowns as a kid but that can be a ton of different things from bipolar to psychosis to extreme anxiety(panic attacks) so it wasn't exactly the main qualifier for autism. and who tf is sauron calling unempathetic! that was disproven before sauron was born in the 60's. actually, data now shows that a lot of us are more empathetic than most people towards animals and are more likely to have a close connection with them. the reason we don't always act the same towards humans is that many of them treat us poorly and we're seen as unempathetic when say our peers who bullied us are getting their just desserts. and honestly, would you feel bad if someone who tried to make you feel like dirt fell down and scraped their knee? how many of you would be empathetic towards sauron is he got a family member diagnosed with a disability after seeing this video? towards the kid for having such a shitty relative definitely. for sauron now realizing what its like to have a family member who is treated like dirt and there is truly nothing, the kid can do to stop it? or if one of the kids bullying his relative did it because they watch alt right wing youtube and disabled people must be kept down so the majority can survive? jesus christ dude if those were the categories for autism i'm pretty sure it would be alt-righters and anti sjw that ended up branded with it"

"7989","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

i have adhd (which is the same kind of disorder as autism and tends to manifest in a lot of similar ways) and ""extreme sensitivity to criticism"" is like. not what sargon thinks it is? it's present in adhd and a lot of other disorders and sometimes called rejection-sensitive dysphoria or rsd--dysphoria basically meaning to feel bad. because that's literally what that is. it's ""someone criticized me a bit and now i'm having a panic attack"" not ""someone has a different opinion so i blocked them on twitter"" or ""i blocked someone on twitter for throwing around ableist slurs"". the ""extreme sensitivity"" is feeling like someone *hates* you or a thing you made because they said something slightly critical, not, like, getting upset at people who defend racists. where i'm from, getting mad at someone who is extremely condescending and advocates for your murder because of your opinions (despite not knowing what your opinions are) is called being a person. 


also sargon linking to autism speaks after that™ is disgusting and proves empirically that he doesn't give two shits and a slice of cake about autistic people. anyone who knows any autistic people (cough cough like i do) knows autism speaks is notorious in that community for being hot ableist garbage"

"8000","let me first say, i love long videos, and i like hearing viewpoints different to mine. i even agree with a few from sargon. but he can go fuck himself with a cactus for stooping down to using autism, something i (and many others)struggle with, even with my own family members, and i'm almost 30, as an insult against radical people he dislikes. i usually don't just degrade myself into hurling insults, but fucking hell... one thing is being derogatory towards radicals, another is equating them with a disorder that isn't one's fault, and often has real, sometimes very severe, consequences. and it's used as an insult to call some retarded or stupid or whatever else it could stand in for. that is fucking scummy.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off. 

blegh, sorry for the outburst, but felt i had to say it."
"8001","i've only listened to the original dude's first ""point"" and i'm sickened. as a feminist i'm offended. as the aunt of an autistic child i'm offended. hell, as a human being i'm offended."
"8002","as a person with asperger's, or autism spectrum disorder as they call it now, that list that sargon uses is flat out wrong for some points. especially lack of empathy. i have never met another autistic person in my life who couldn't have empathy. the thing is, is that some of us (not even all of us) have a hard time expressing feelings of empathy. but just because we don't always outwardly express our feelings of empathy, doesn't mean we don't have it. i've even heard other people argue that autistic people have more empathy, but i'm not really gonna argue that point because i don't have a way of actually confirming if that is true."

"8013","i'm autistic and comparing me to sargon is insulting"
"8014","i had a hunch that sargon's banter is correlated to nixon's southern strategy: cherrypicking radical outliers, abstracting words, and proclaiming he's right to his audience."
"8015","i'd have thought sargon would have very little experience of recognising when a sexual encounter is being initiated."
"8016","it makes me sad to think that there was a time when i would've liked sargon's video."
"8017","a few years ago, autistics were all over youtube, talking about their condition, educating people, having conversations with each other, sharing information about the condition and comparing notes. it looked like people were really getting smarter about the true nature of autisms in it's many diverse forms. and now? idiots are just using the word to insult everybody they don't like. man have we slipped backward.
   anyway, we know that sargon isn't autistic. he isn't smart enough."

"8020","to think that you could look up a list of indicators that someone might have autism and then use those indicators to diagnose anyone with autism, proves you know nothing about it. autism isn't just a ""if you do these things then you have it"" type of deal. it's way bigger than that. someone could (and probably does) have autism and not exhibit any of the ""indicators"" that he listed in his video."

"8025","lmao, what is this guy smoking!? i do not have a tumbler account and not a feminist; although i sympathize with them. 
i kind of agree with sargon that i tend to not pick up ques with women unless if they were verbal; however that is more a sexual preference. i prefer women that are happy in the relationship and prefer not to get into a relationship willy-nilly. if i get into a relationship willy-nilly, i run the risk of creeping the woman out and they lose their sexual appeal; due to fear and anger.
fear and anger is not sexy."
"8026","i actually am autistic and i don't recall ""not taking criticism well"" being a sign. but this is quoting an article that, from what was shown, was written by someone who isn't a doctor or has any training in any form of relevant medicine and her only connection seems to be she's convinced her husband is autistic. so not exactly medically accurate information he's quoting."
"8027","you fuck, you just exposed me to leafyishere i've got 15 kinds of cancer now"
"8028","jebus, i knew enough about sargon to know that he was an absolute moron enamored with appearing intelligent to similarly unintelligent people, but i wasn't expecting that degree of vitriolic hate - i'd only ever heard him kind of indignantly and sarcastically drone on, but that was like... like molyneux levels of pathetic hatred. kind of feel bad for him now..."

"8032","i have absolutely no clue why these people are using ""autistic"" as an insult. i have high-functioning autism, and it has actually given me advantages as a working musician and artist. one of the most common symptoms of autism is hyper-focusing, and that's a great skill to have in the workplace."
"8033","i'm autistic and i'm tired of having to coexist with such decrepit mongrels!lol"
"8034","i love that sargon's complete inability to see autism as anything but a buzzword makes him not even realize why we do studies on different rates of diagnosis or why underdiagnosis of a condition is a problem at all (a hint: it's because autistic folks are *gasp* people! and ones who might need additional support especially when growing up! and going undiagnosed for a developmental disorder can majorly fuck with your self esteem! what a surprise!)"

( not caring about womens issues outside of the west...ie western centric feminism. misandrists, terfs, anti-bisexuals, transphobes ect.) or at least called the fuck out. because when you  affect change that legally redefines rape to the exclusion of men and female abusers, i have a real problem with you. that said, sargon is absolutely full of shit. this entire thing is him going ""reeeeeeeeee"" over the fact that in this instance it really is a feminist issue. women and girls aren't being properly diagnosed with mental health issues due to the way females uniquely present. (i suspect due to those annoying gender roles and expectations)  which is hurting them...i don't get why...that's such a bad thing..?  ""do you want more autistic people!!!!!!!!!?????"" uh no...we want a better way to diagnose women with mental health issues, especially autism because, and this might shock you, male and female brains are wired  differently and respond differently to stimuli. weird..for someone who goes on and on about criticle thinking and skepticism...he doesn't do much of being either non?"
"8040","now, i don't have concrete numbers to prove it, so someone correct me, if i'm wrong, but .. health care spending  _cannot ever_ be equal in amount for men and women, unless pregnancy becomes available for men, which i doubt will ever happen. 
starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."
"8041","alt right comment section gave me aids"
"8042","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"8050","i hate men that speak that way about feminists, its just gross and its amusing they don't see that.  i be they have rape fantasy"
"8051","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

"8076","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"8077","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"8078","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"8079","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."
"8080","sargon was very disrespectful to autists."
"8081","anyone notice that those are all autistic stereotypes he's using and no actually diagnosing material? when i was diagnosed with autism the main signs in my case was speech development, delays, taking metaphors literally or just not understanding them properly, my ultra sensitive ears which caused me a lot of pain. i did have meltdowns as a kid but that can be a ton of different things from bipolar to psychosis to extreme anxiety(panic attacks) so it wasn't exactly the main qualifier for autism. and who tf is sauron calling unempathetic! that was disproven before sauron was born in the 60's. actually, data now shows that a lot of us are more empathetic than most people towards animals and are more likely to have a close connection with them. the reason we don't always act the same towards humans is that many of them treat us poorly and we're seen as unempathetic when say our peers who bullied us are getting their just desserts. and honestly, would you feel bad if someone who tried to make you feel like dirt fell down and scraped their knee? how many of you would be empathetic towards sauron is he got a family member diagnosed with a disability after seeing this video? towards the kid for having such a shitty relative definitely. for sauron now realizing what its like to have a family member who is treated like dirt and there is truly nothing, the kid can do to stop it? or if one of the kids bullying his relative did it because they watch alt right wing youtube and disabled people must be kept down so the majority can survive? jesus christ dude if those were the categories for autism i'm pretty sure it would be alt-righters and anti sjw that ended up branded with it"

"8089","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

"8097","right so i'm very late and this is kind of only tangentially related but it was getting on my nerves
i have adhd (which is the same kind of disorder as autism and tends to manifest in a lot of similar ways) and ""extreme sensitivity to criticism"" is like. not what sargon thinks it is? it's present in adhd and a lot of other disorders and sometimes called rejection-sensitive dysphoria or rsd--dysphoria basically meaning to feel bad. because that's literally what that is. it's ""someone criticized me a bit and now i'm having a panic attack"" not ""someone has a different opinion so i blocked them on twitter"" or ""i blocked someone on twitter for throwing around ableist slurs"". the ""extreme sensitivity"" is feeling like someone *hates* you or a thing you made because they said something slightly critical, not, like, getting upset at people who defend racists. where i'm from, getting mad at someone who is extremely condescending and advocates for your murder because of your opinions (despite not knowing what your opinions are) is called being a person.

"8100","let me first say, i love long videos, and i like hearing viewpoints different to mine. i even agree with a few from sargon. but he can go fuck himself with a cactus for stooping down to using autism, something i (and many others)struggle with, even with my own family members, and i'm almost 30, as an insult against radical people he dislikes. i usually don't just degrade myself into hurling insults, but fucking hell... one thing is being derogatory towards radicals, another is equating them with a disorder that isn't one's fault, and often has real, sometimes very severe, consequences. and it's used as an insult to call some retarded or stupid or whatever else it could stand in for. that is fucking scummy.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off.

(i suspect due to those annoying gender roles and expectations)  which is hurting them...i don't get why...that's such a bad thing..?

"8140","now, i don't have concrete numbers to prove it, so someone correct me, if i'm wrong, but .. health care spending  _cannot ever_ be equal in amount for men and women, unless pregnancy becomes available for men, which i doubt will ever happen. 
starting with hormonal birth control, in my country, a woman is required to see an ob-gyn for a check-up _twice a year_, even if health-wise everything is ok, otherwise she won't get a prescription. getting pregnant with issues of fertility requires medication and procedures sometimes. pregnancy itself requires very frequent check-ups, including ultrasounds, blood-testing; often nutritional supplements are required, sometimes medication or procedures or surgery, if the pregnancy has some kind of complication. then there's giving birth, the expenditures and possible complications of which hopefully need no explaining. finally, there's post-natal care, which also involves check-ups, and potentially medication, procedures or surgery or even psychiatric treatment.
_all_ of these things are billed within the health insurance system as _women's_ health care, in my country at least, so it's only logical that it's more expensive than men's health care.

another thing that occurred to me, but here it's pure speculation, is that to my vague knowledge, there's much more female prostitutes than male prostitutes. as a result, i would assume that by proportion more women have to seek regular check-ups or treatment for stds than men. 
what i absolutely _do_ know by numbers, is that according to police statistics, in my country 93% of victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse are female. therefore, also in this sector, women require much more medical and psychiatric treatment than men."
"8141","alt right comment section gave me aids"
"8142","i think the biggest gripe sargon has with feminism and many other anti-fems is that they're not focusing hard enough of male-centric issues and choosing to instead to focus their efforts on women-centric issues pretty consistently. a good example of the feminist equivalent but that appeals to a greater extent to men is the mgtow community, but that's because their dialogue focuses on male-centric issues and dealing with them in a way that most men are more comfortable with.

you can argue that mgtow as a anti-feminist group and their misogynistic ideals are less healthy than feminism or is worse, but even so it's a community that strives to empower men in contrast to feminism that more often than not give a lot more weight to disempowering men to the favor of women because even if they acknowledge that the patriarcy hurts men their priorities doesn't lie in the interest of men but of the interest of women every time their interest conflict. that's the biggest flaw of feminism and that's why mgtow are anti-feminist."

"8151","having known several people on the autistic scale, friends and family, distant acquaintances through internet - i find they often end up on the ends of the scale on politics. so, i have no doubt there are many feminists on the autistic scale. i am a progressive, yet i have many times been blocked by saying things neither offensive nor particularly critical, such as ""bernie sanders would make a better president than hillary clinton"".

being repeatedly blocked by such a simple statement - seeing how some people cannot cope with people with differing beliefs - was somewhat shocking to me. and i understand that when right-wingers meet people like this, then that is what makes them extrapolate that all feminists are autistic. which is of course absurd. and not only is this absurd being just a small sample of feminists, it's also absurd because you find _the exact same behaviour among people on the other side of the scale_

one of this cases on the other side of this scale is a friend of mine. i've come to know him well, and i know that when it comes to politics i just have to let him ramble on about libertarianism or ayn rand until he stops, because he has no way to deal with criticism. he has been diagnosed with being on the autistic scale, after all. but, a common friend i have is not as careful as i am, and when confronted with the libertarian ramblings he gave his opinion back. they had known each other and been friends for some 30 years. but this simple criticism was just too much, so he decided to break of all relations with this rude man who had the audacity to _criticize the holy words of ayn rand._ after that, he also stopped having contact with me, even though i had completely stayed out of the entire thing, wasn't even present when they had their discussion, and didn't side with either side in any way at all.

i know also of other cases, where people diagnosed with autism is on the right side of politics, for instance one childhood friend who is an alt-righter anti-muslim.

people in the autism scale are just naturally attracted to ideological extremes. they handle information, and not social situations, so whether they end up as feminists or alt-righters - they find it more comfortable living in a clean and clear world where the truth is evident. that truth might be science, it might be religion, and it might be political ideologies.

i just want to end this by saying, that even though i highlighted some of the bad aspects of being in the autistic scale; i certainly understand there are a lot of positive aspects as well. which is why i have ended up befriending people who are on the autistic scale all my life. these bad aspects i mentioned are merely symptoms, and often these individuals fight their symptoms internally and suffers the pain of it alone.

lastly, anyone with autism has the right of an opinion, whether it be alt-right or feminism. and, pointing out they have autism does not somehow magically remove their arguments. often, they have more rational and clear arguments than us normies are even capable of digesting. so, what sargon of akkad is trying to do here, is thus flawed on so many levels. he is generalizing all feminists due to some feminists he has encountered who have displayed autistic symptoms, then he is generalizing all autists due to some he has assumed are on the autistic scale, then he thinks this is evidence their reasoning and cause is wrong(even if all autists had been feminists, we would still have to take their arguments seriously). sargon of akkad is disrespectful on so many levels, and he is in particular disrespectful to any of his own listeners who might be on the autistic scale as well. imagine someone who actually likes sargon, who agrees with him, but has a diagnosis on the autistic scale like asperger - imagine him having to listen to sargon using autism as a cheap point, and demonizing the condition. asperger are perfectly capable of having opinions, and many people with asperger have changed the world, the world would not have been as we know it without them."

let me be real fuckin' clear about this sargon! autism is not the same thing as retarded! autism is not being intolerant! don't be putting your own self as if it's the same as autism! autism is a disorder that affects a person's social life! it affects the part of the brain that helps manage social anxiety and such! it simply means the person has a disadvantage in dealing with people socially! it does not mean they are dumb! it does not mean they are stupid! 
honestly for saying something like this if i ever see you in person, i am clocking you right in the face! 
and by the gods' sake do some fucking research from actual proffesionals you absolute sad needy little shit!

"8176","if you defended elliot rodger, you aren't defending him killing people; so no, the point is not obvious. so i'll make one for you. the idea is that elliot rodger killed people because he is a violent, misogynistic, bitter, entitled male. by association, you must also share some of these qualities with elliot rodger, you know, because he was a totally rational man who seemed to know what he wanted and believed.

the kind of man who would shoot a person, then try to mop up the blood hopelessly with some paper towels and put it in the toilet because, ""oh, shit, what have i done?"" his mental illness does matter, because it removes elliot rodger's agency in that event. i mean besides him not having any control in the first place.

this framing of elliot rodger as being a bitter reject is really not doing society any favours, because his isolation is what allowed him to be radicalized in the first place. how did he become isolated? he was bullied. i know that others are going to reference 'but he had friends' but, this isn't really what kind of isolation i'm talking about.

so elliot rodgers is miserable, for a long time. he spends a lot of time talking on the internet. he expresses his discontent with the world, which is partly explained by his childhood and his mental health - the internet, being a wealth of answers, puts his feelings into perspective. he joins up with a bunch of communities after seeing that they're explaining why he is so miserable, he gets fed the idea that he's an incel. an involuntary celibate, and that women are out to spite him, a beta male.

this is vastly more easy for rodgers to believe in because he was at one point diagnosed as having a schizophrenic condition. and, believe it or not, antipsychotics like risperidone are indeed prescribed for people who show schizophrenic symptoms. if you're not familiar with what schizophrenia entails, hold on, because this is a shocker. it's about delusional perceptions of the world around you. paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by the incessant beliefs that others are out to get you, what happens when you have someone who is vulnerable to delusions in an environment full of people who are telling you that women are out to spite you?

he starts believing in them. this is exacerbated by him finding solace more on the internet, where this radicalization can occur.

given the scenario that you can imagine a bunch of absolute fucking disgusting frog men sitting around telling him that he's an incel due to the fact that women are 'bitches and whores', can you blame elliot rodgers entirely? and remember, mental illness isn't just some shit that you control like it's got an on and off switch. someone poking the schizophrenia with a stick, is riling a very terrible, capable beast. they lied to him. these groups of men who told him that the reason he was never getting laid because women were out spiting him, lied to him. and to be honest, i would not have been surprised if he also got a lot of bullying over the incel shit.

in this way you can 'defend' elliot rodgers as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. and he is being used as a tool of blame by both feminists (in laci's words, blaming violent masculinity and what it means to be a man as the issue), and in sargon's opinion, feminism. though to be honest, laci's kind of almost, sort of right, but not really.

she's right that the idea, the delusion of what it meant to be a man, and the conspiracy against elliot, was what made him kill? no, his mental illness, which made this delusion far worse, amplified the insanity, is what ultimately sent him over the edge. she also goes on to blame society at large, like this is something that's common. when you should know, violent masculinity is not the ideal, or 'mainstream', and does not represent a normal viewpoint.

i know that laci wanted to make this an issue with toxic masculinity itself or something. but if he had not been mentally ill, it may well be that elliot rodgers would never have even killed someone. he would not have done so, and if that's true, then it stands to reason that toxic masculinity and a societal conspiracy to encourage it, cannot be the reason that elliot rodgers killed someone.

but in the same vein. sargon also can't really make the conclusion either, about feminism. which he does. and although he may have been pissed at people for basically doing the same to him, you know, it's up to him to control his temper after all. he's a grown ass man. he doesn't need to make bollocks points which he himself refutes with his own logic, because he's an adult."
"8177","man, i love this channel. so glad i've discovered it.
keep up the great work. :)"
"8178","as for sargon's mentioning of feminists talking about no gender differences existing. that's actually a reference to a trope(?) about women who identify as feminists rejecting the idea of sexual dimorphism in the human species. due to the idea that men being different than women on a biological level would be like, the definition of sexism. the belief that men or women are inherently different? well, not exactly. the issue is that the sexist interpretation must include the sentiments that men are inherently superior to women, to be sexist. and strength, or size, is a very simplistic thing to use when arguing about this.

it is conceivable in sargon's opinion that a feminist exists who has explicitly stated that the existence of a sexual difference between male and female muscle mass averages is sexist. this is the entire point of the argument, also, you do know what he's referring to as well, because you're not unaware of the idea that sex differences in social characteristics are innate. i.e; evolutionary behaviors.

i personally do not doubt that certain evolved behaviors may exist which simply appear more in women through gene expression than in males. it's entirely plausible that there are some sex differences in the average outcome of women, socially, even when you remove environmental inputs. what i do not often see is much evidence which finds these things, although, i'm also just 'kinda confident' that it could exist.

that's more about my own laziness of the subject, tbh, and it's why i usually don't make any claims as to the actual behaviors. when i see many of these people talk about sex differences and social outcomes, frankly i do think they're talking a bit of shit. because they cannot point to the evidence as they don't have any. they use the assumption that these differences may exist for granted to handwave many things. including as you'll recall, the reason the gender gap exists.

but that's not the only issue that i have with them, i also have an issue with them making a big deal out of the outlier. the statistical populations which usually defy expectations of normal behavior. why is it such an issue at all whether there are different personality's among women? and even more importantly, how does this factor into the gender gap issue itself? so we have a scenario where women are being rejected from medical professions in certain hospitals to fit a male quota. they do this because 'on average' women go on to have kids and the company must pay leave for them. the hospital gets less from them in this period, which is also a public health issue when the hospitals struggle to staff their positions on their leave.

so they hire more men. they don't do this purely out of sexism, but statistics. this fucks over the woman who is not the average. she is being treated as non-exceptional, she has no voice, is that fair? for instance, she might well never have kids. yet she'd still be rejected from that institution. how are the hospitals supposed to know what she'll do? if she is allowed the position, how do they test for that guarantee? i don't think there is a way to do that. 

back to sargon. he's appealing to people who are being grouped in with the average person and apparently slandered by feminists as supporting sexist positions when talking about science. they're actually not sexist, they're just wrong. from their perspective, they're doing something based on the assumption that they read the stats right, how can it be sexist to say that women act in a certain way when it is true statistically? from observations they trust that this is just reality. of course it may not be (isn't).

i'd like to think that whilst i was essentially 'this person' minus any statements that certainly identify particular habits or behaviors as 'feminine' and come up with bullshit reasons that this is so. i did believe it was plausible that men and women had them. i'd like to think that i was not a minority among the skeptical. and it's always been pretty touch and go with sargon and the like. i was always just standing off enough to hear him out but wondering if he's going to make some spurious bullshit claim amid the dog whistling. i get the strawman that he was attacking but he's not a studying man.

much more pertinent to this issue is thunderf00t. who has in fact encountered a feminist, who has told him that the differences in behavior between men and women are not biologically. basically telling him to prove it. and maybe they will? that's the thing with saying that these differences are innate and occur due to gene expression. it works because everything about you can be a consequence of different gene expression. the problem is that only one chromosome has changed in expression in the genome when we're talking about sex, and no gene on that chromosome has been causally linked to biological 'social differences'.

so she's not wrong in pointing out it doesn't exist, because nobody has found it yet. more pertinent is that there is a pretty pathetic gun jumping going on with more radical sexists. who have not only reached the spurious conclusion that women are different due to innate differences, but go on to state that certain behaviors are more prevalent among women due to them (these behaviors are not proven norms). you know the type. talks about the innate sexual desires of women to go after dominant, aggressive assholes. black pidgeon kind of shit, totally unsubstantiated bollocks.

i really think going for thunderfoot on this one is a much more salient target to them than going for sargon. sargon is 'duh politician' in the minds of these guys. but thunderfoot is the scientist. he's the one that you need to get on matters of debate about women's biological differences. because he is the more authoritative person about it. sargon was already rejected (think of this group dynamic drama among toobers!) by thunderfoot, or more aptly. sargon attacked thunderfoot, betraying him! over his different interpretations over the shitshow of brexit. at which point, sargon was proven to be a bit more inept that many had given credit for.

i kind of like this diversity to be honest, two people believe in roughly the same idea? they're sort of on the same page. but you can really see the rift of understanding form on certain topics when they clash. 's great entertainment.

thunderfoot also being a generally intelligent man, is actually also pretty good at the subjects he chooses to cover. you might have noticed in the comment that quip about him being 'the scientist' and figured, isn't that the socially awkward smart guy trope? well, you wouldn't be wrong. this is the gist of sargon's attack against him, when he called thunderfoot out on his dissension over brexit. he very much tries to push the idea that he's a people person, and thunder is not. at least this is reflected in some of the comments between the channel.

as it happens though. thunderfoot is typically more sane. and i'm not the only one who thinks so either."
"8179","maybe the stigma around vulnerability is about what the observer thinks of themselves when they see reality take effect. for example, when we see someone do something amazing we're rewarded with pleasant sensations, we could do that? it's an amazing feat, fun. but suffering is usually the opposite. others being weak highlights our own potential weakness. that they could fail mirrors our own potential for failure, and this discomfort leads to acting out against it.

it could follow, if a stigma of old people exists; that it's supposedly based on our avoidance of death. the ultimate weakness of someone, from which all other fears are connected. the fear of death is the source. it might also be that bizarrely, we attack weak people that we care about because we do not know how to effectively solve the problem, we might be more simple than we give ourselves credit for.

there's also the possibility that everyone is expected to be able to solve the world's problems before them, and a failure to save others leads the observer to assume that this is a personal failing. that they are the reason that there is an issue. we like to help each other, it's an instinct i'd say. so when we see the suffering and can't help someone it can affect us negatively. we start to get bitter about the problem, eventually discarding it to defend ourselves. it's their problem, they should be viewed with contempt for their problems, helps to discount the suffering of being powerless to help them."
"8180","sargon was very disrespectful to autists."
"8181","anyone notice that those are all autistic stereotypes he's using and no actually diagnosing material? when i was diagnosed with autism the main signs in my case was speech development, delays, taking metaphors literally or just not understanding them properly, my ultra sensitive ears which caused me a lot of pain. i did have meltdowns as a kid but that can be a ton of different things from bipolar to psychosis to extreme anxiety(panic attacks) so it wasn't exactly the main qualifier for autism. and who tf is sauron calling unempathetic! that was disproven before sauron was born in the 60's. actually, data now shows that a lot of us are more empathetic than most people towards animals and are more likely to have a close connection with them. the reason we don't always act the same towards humans is that many of them treat us poorly and we're seen as unempathetic when say our peers who bullied us are getting their just desserts. and honestly, would you feel bad if someone who tried to make you feel like dirt fell down and scraped their knee? how many of you would be empathetic towards sauron is he got a family member diagnosed with a disability after seeing this video? towards the kid for having such a shitty relative definitely. for sauron now realizing what its like to have a family member who is treated like dirt and there is truly nothing, the kid can do to stop it? or if one of the kids bullying his relative did it because they watch alt right wing youtube and disabled people must be kept down so the majority can survive? jesus christ dude if those were the categories for autism i'm pretty sure it would be alt-righters and anti sjw that ended up branded with it"

"8189","women's health is treated more seriously because they give birth, they require more medical care for that and, because the baby grows inside the woman's body, and not the mans, the woman needs more attention given to her during the birth process from start to finish. men have the amount of health care required and can purchase further health care if they feel they need it. i am fine with the people who will grow a human inside of them after i've sweat and groaned over them getting more care than i do. women's health may (as of this comment i haven't done research into this, i'm about to bike to work) also include psychological health and welfare since being a mother is challenging and hormonal and requires a strong will, as well as women being more likely to be raped than men or need to terminate a pregnancy (a man can't terminate a pregnancy without killing the mother, that's murder, ""killing"" a thing growing in you that you don't want to ruin your life is called a free choice a human can make because the thing isn't yet a person and will not suffer from this because they lack person-hood), so if i am correct about those points alone, it would mansplain the gap in healthcare, but even if i'm not the other points are valid and would explain a lot of the gap. men don't wanna give power away to women, but i say fuck it. my cock doesn't decide who i am, i do, and i am proud to be a man who stands up for the equal rights of all humans, since we live once and then die and life is, on the whole, intrinsically meaningless, i think it's very important to make life as bearable and kind for everyone as it is within our power to do. these women have a right to ask to be treated equally. do i agree with everything they say? not really, some thing are a little out there, but then again i have to concede that i am not a woman and i don't know how something is perceived by another human being who has a mind and self of their own, therefore it would at the least disingenuous to say they have no idea what they are talking about when i am clearly the one who doesn't."

"8197","right so i'm very late and this is kind of only tangentially related but it was getting on my nerves
i have adhd (which is the same kind of disorder as autism and tends to manifest in a lot of similar ways) and ""extreme sensitivity to criticism"" is like. not what sargon thinks it is? it's present in adhd and a lot of other disorders and sometimes called rejection-sensitive dysphoria or rsd--dysphoria basically meaning to feel bad. because that's literally what that is. it's ""someone criticized me a bit and now i'm having a panic attack"" not ""someone has a different opinion so i blocked them on twitter"" or ""i blocked someone on twitter for throwing around ableist slurs"". the ""extreme sensitivity"" is feeling like someone *hates* you or a thing you made because they said something slightly critical, not, like, getting upset at people who defend racists. where i'm from, getting mad at someone who is extremely condescending and advocates for your murder because of your opinions (despite not knowing what your opinions are) is called being a person.

very occasionally, i can use it 100% in fun (like a comedic outburst with obsessiveness or something), or if i think it describes something adequately (like a character from a tv series or something), but never ever as an insult. 

i really fucking hate when people turn something like autism into a derogatory term with no regard for what they're actually saying, and how it can affect actual autists. i've had so many issues with it where people just called me dumb, lazy, weirdo etc. being ostricized as a child because i was just different has consequences, and when 'intellectuals' like sargon contribute to using autism as a derogatory mocking term, i get a little pissed. and i am really not that easy to piss off.

"8228","jebus, i knew enough about sargon to know that he was an absolute moron enamored with appearing intelligent to similarly unintelligent people, but i wasn't expecting that degree of vitriolic hate - i'd only ever heard him kind of indignantly and sarcastically drone on, but that was like... like molyneux levels of pathetic hatred. kind of feel bad for him now..."
"8229","23:40 onward is everything you need to ever know about sargon"
"8230","welp... good thing he was put up to create the definition of the word autism. good thing he wasn't put up to create meaning in any words because well... you know... he can't read lol."
"8231","number of viewings before i concluded that a youtube personality was full of shit: ben shapiro, 0.1 (just his voice makes me throw up); stefan molyneux, 2; prager u, 2; sargon, 5; thunderfoot, 10; jordan peterson, 15. actually, i have a degree in psychology, so it was peterson i spotted first (a mish-mash of jungian pseudo-science, cherry-picked studies and bits of evolutionary psychology, causation inferred from correlation, applying statistical findings to individuals, etc., all in defence of ideas drummed into him as a child in small-town bible-belt alberta. jung's father was lutheran pastor, so there's the affinity). but he is a more interesting phony than the others."
"8232","i have absolutely no clue why these people are using ""autistic"" as an insult. i have high-functioning autism, and it has actually given me advantages as a working musician and artist. one of the most common symptoms of autism is hyper-focusing, and that's a great skill to have in the workplace."
"8233","i'm autistic and i'm tired of having to coexist with such decrepit mongrels!lol"
"8234","i love that sargon's complete inability to see autism as anything but a buzzword makes him not even realize why we do studies on different rates of diagnosis or why underdiagnosis of a condition is a problem at all (a hint: it's because autistic folks are *gasp* people! and ones who might need additional support especially when growing up! and going undiagnosed for a developmental disorder can majorly fuck with your self esteem! what a surprise!)"

"8238","sargon isn't very epic."
"8239","it isn't very funny. why are people making excuses."
"8240","the problem with mediocre jokes stretched to no end is what i have in every scary movie movie since part 2 and all following ripoffs like fantastic movie, date movie and whatever sequels there were.
a few good jokes and many lame jokes stretched to a point where you only wish for a scene to finally end.

bad editing at its worst. i fully agree that the ghost busters remake could have made way better.

stretch a joke too much and it just becomes very awkward to sit through. and awkward humor might work in a jim carrey movie or the wayne's world movies. 
they depend on it and viewers know what they get. it depends on unique, charismatic and crazy characters to deliver it in just the right dosis.

but it certainly doesn't work in normal comedy movies."
"8241","not going to lie.. it's a bad sign for a comedy movie when some random youtuber's edited version actually makes you laugh :d i legit cracked a smile during the ""suck it"" part and the whole ""getting fired"" bit cutting off at charles dance doing this stern sigh and her going ""who's thaaaat?"" made me burst out loud.

now i wish there was a shorter, funny cut of the film."
"8242","i agree with a lot of what you say here, but i do have one little nitpick: when talking about the ways in which dialogue ruins the comedy in the movie, you use the example of the proton pack being turned on for the first time arguing that if melissa mccarthy weren't talking the joke would have landed, like it did in the original. i think you're right that it doesn't land, but i think that it's in the direction and staging, rather than the dialogue or lack thereof. in the original, all parties involved are present in one shot, so the turning on of the machine and subsequent backing away are one continuous ""thought"". set up and punchline in one spot. there's also the visual gag that they're in an elevator so the space is enclosed and there's nowhere really for egon to back away to. on top of that there's the layer that they're in the field, about to use this technology which egon presumably designed that he now, just before using it in a public place, is unsure of. in the new one, all of those layers are stripped away. it's a test, nobody knows if it'll work so backing away is reasonable. they're outside, so there's plenty of space to back away. the two shot set up has no eye-trace, that is, melissa mccarthy is the single subject of one shot and the reaction cuts to dual focus in a relatively different part of the screen, leaving the viewer scrambling for a visual anchor while they miss the joke. you could be right that if all of that was fixed mccarthy's line could still blow the joke, but i think there's sort of a magnum opus of directional failure getting in the way of that being a conclusive reason for it. wow that was way longer than i thought it would be when i started typing."
"8243","the rating at the end killed me."
"8244","gattaca"
"8245","the biggest problem i find with this movie is that they have a good joke followed with a bad one. like the one with dan as a taxi driver. he spouts all lot of knowledge about ghosts and then follows it with ""i believe in no ghosts""
i thought is was very okay. wouldn't seek it out but it if would be on i might stay for a watch."
"8246","all the jokes you showed as examples of what are bad jokes made me laugh out loud having not seen the movie so i might just be dumb"
"8247","stuck to his own premise. kudos. made me chuckle."
"8248","i personally loved the movie"
"8249","spooktacular!"
"8250","i feel like every scene of this movie is a scene ive seen elsewhere done properly. like the flipping the bird scene was totally not at all like that bruce almighty scene. dont know if you bring that one up yet but omg this movie gives me terminal cancer"
"8251","kevin's character isn't just he's stupid, it that he stupid and beefcake."
"8252","funny--i thought holzman was the best part of the movie, and the mismatch came from wiig's style of humor not really ""fitting"". of course, being a socially stunted anxiety-ridden shy kid, cracking jokes and being weird like holzman is precisely how i deal with people in the real world--so seeing that represented was great. and her bit at the end cemented her character for me."
"8253","it sounds like a lot of this comes down to american vs british humor. a lot of americans like more obvious humor, if that makes any sense."
"8254","""small....far awayyy..."" 😂😂😂"
"8255","on an aside, charles dance is amazing, especially when it comes to 'modern speak' played with disdain. just look at all the big fat quiz segments with him in it, where he reads autobiographies from young weirdos"
"8256","brilliant. especially your modified/reedited scenes were way better than the original."
"8257","not a huge fan about this particular movie, but i did have a question about mel brooks films.  he's one of my top 5 directors, and he had the opposite opinion on comedy editing than you have just proposed.  he believed and i'm paraphrasing here, to machine gun in gags and jokes into every scene.  if the verbal joke fails to land than the physical one may keep the audience entertained, his theory is that if you fill the script/screen with enough jokes all the time, at least 1 will land per scene.  he approached his comedy like a shotgun, trying to hit every demographics funny button, so the low brow slap stick will work for group x, the racy humor will work for y and the pitter patter dialogue will work for z, while the puns may work for group w and so on.  do you like his films?  or is it that the flaw of ghost busters was that it's humor wasn't shotgun so much as a rifle and they just keep firing in the same spot over and over and over again.  

mind you i did not find the movie terrible, just...  not good.  i wish gb3's original script or the 3rd script could have been used, i find the lack of baton toss and the overall all ""reboot"" nature of this is very detrimental to the series...  it made me go in ""on defense"" rather than being able to enjoy the movie on it's own merit.  it forced me to view it as an alternative competition to what i love, rather than a continuation (or even a lovely spinoff) of what i love.  it rubbed me the wrong way."
"8258","i am now a fan of shaun... incidentally, having never seen the movie, i feel slightly embarrassed to admit that i found the 'michael hat' joke funny."
"8259","it seems like they didn't actually write any jokey jokes, they just let them talk. like, they never shut up. someone's always commenting. always yelling. it's noisy and crowded with speech that has no purpose (well i believe the original purpose is comedy but it doesn't work.). to me this movie is the equivalent of the guy in your class who thinks he's funny, so he keeps talking while everyone else is talking. and he keeps getting louder. or the dad who thinks he's funny and he keeps trying to tell jokey jokes. and both butt into other conversations, stopping them and just keep talking to look for the joke!!!"
"8260","wow you edit better than sony"
"8261","brilliant work."
"8262","i quite liked the ""mike hat""-line."
"8263","i bet i was laughing more about this review than i would aout the film"
"8264","sometimes, less is more."
"8265","15:30 we need to talk about kevin"
"8266","still better than ghost busters 2"
"8267","pretty good video until you said the movie isn't funny because women aren't funny... kinda killed it"
"8268","if you think bombs are so funny why didn't you think the movie was funny? ohhh! and now my serious bit; it was indeed edited for shit, patti was fired and that was in the first draft script (nailed it shaun!), holtzmann had a whole explaining why she uses applied sciences to find ghosts, and the whole thing with bill murray had every plot relevant dialogue cut to make way for the goofeyness. they did this because kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy made their entire career on unfunny drawn out awkwardness, and it sucks paul feig let those two just reuse their old shitty style make the movie terrible. ivan rietman should have stepped in and said, ""i understand this came from snl people originally, and the sentiment of having your snl brand of humor prevalent is important to recognize, but this isn't a 4 minute skit.""  but he didn't because he himself uses drawn out gags as the premise for his mediocre movies. they also could have done better with one loud character instead of 16, i like leslie jones' style of stating something loud and proud and then ending on the ""i might be wrong about some of that."" note. but anything that patti said humorously was almost immediately out-shouted by abby. shaun, you need to edit some of these movies, i agree with you that it would be a better film, and from the comments i've read here, so does everyone else."
"8269","least your criticism of the film is not the typical 'sjw this' or 'feminists that'."
"8270","alternate title for this vid: the desperate search for a sliver lining of one of the worst cash-grab piece-of-shit films ever made.
keep searching you fucking cuck."
"8271","that ending caught me off guard and it was great."
"8272","i had a pretty good time at the  ""suck it"" scene, but only as far as the ""suck it"" part."
"8273","wait. where exactly are you from shaun?! i always struggled placing you from your accent, but that father ted thing, hui! don't tell me you are from the wesht!"
"8274","1:22 why does controversy annoys you? based on your videos you would probably never do video on this movie if there was no controversy."
"8275","an interesting rumour i heard about this was the script writer had to disown the work as about 90% of the script didn't get into the film. all the nonsense about anti irish fencing and the likes was ad-libed and paul fiege was don't right bad at reigning in the actors when they went off script so there's not just minutes but hours of unused footage for the entire film.

to put this into comparison, though across some genre lines. david lynch and stanley kubrick have been known to film the same scene over a hundred times to get dialogue and reactions that fit perfectly. numerous times the actors said the exact phrase with minor or occasional changes. paul feige on the other hand filmed scene's and just forgot to say cut when the scene was over because he was hoping the film would write itself and the editor would know what to keep and what to dismiss.

i've not had the courage to read it myself, because the film lost me at the first queef joke and i barely made it to past the concert before i turned it off... but just think if you were the writer of a decent script and it turned out like this."
"8276","i've spent a long time puzzling over how this happened. the interesting thing about the editing is that it was edited by brent white, who also edited basically every good judd apatow movie. and in fact, i would go so far as to say that paul feig was _trying_ to make an apatow movie. apatow's movies are, like ghostbusters, produced by gathering a large amount of largely improvisational content, and then stitching it into a cohesive movie. and that process is obviously heavily reliant on a great editor. but it's also dependent on a good director.

so while it does superficially seem like the movie's problems are largely a matter of editing, i'm more tempted to blame the direction. i don't think feig knew how to get good raw material out of his actors. i don't think he got any footage of them _not_ talking. so as you said, the ideal cut would only be forty minutes long (i think that might be generous), which probably would have upset the studio. and even then, almost all of the jokes would still have been weak; they just wouldn't be _painful_."
"8277","the problem incessant rambling of improvised bits is not limited to this movie. i feel like it has sunk a number of recent comedies, i've seen. as an actor, i can tell you i've been on many a set where the director at some point says, ""let's do a couple improv takes."" most struggling actors in hollywood are told to take improv classes when not working. i, myself, have been in an improv group. i think there is more to acting than just being able to improvise.there is certainly more to making a movie than filming actors improvising and just putting all on screen as you very rightly show with your editing examples. i love your work shaun. keep going. please."
"8278","well, now the world knows that hemsworth is actually very funny."
"8279","no! ya gotta include the ""oh , you were right."" after ""suck. it."" before the cut! that was the real tag! come on!"
"8280","ahahahah the end bit"
"8281","i think it was a really bad film. i mean really, really bad. but the worst movie ever made? no way. i watch so many films that were far worse, this one doesn't even comes close."
"8282","i think some of the unfunny scenes weren't even in the script. i heard somewhere, that there was a lot of adlib-ing on the set. the ""mike hat"" sounds like exactly the kind of joke, an actor would improvise on a bad day.

oh, also ""father ted"" is simply wonderful. one of my favorite britcoms."
"8283","i think they were trying to imitate judd appatow."
"8284","for the ""suck it"" scene, i would've cut it right after whatsherfuck says ""you were right"". they started the little ""bet"" thing when mccarthy guessed what the dean would say and i personally think it's funnier to see that to completion"
"8285","your cuts are really good dude"
"8286","yeah, i saw this today and majority of the movie fell flat for me. it had 1 high point, but the ending was underwhelming."
"8287","honestly, i did enjoy this movie, but i think the reason many didn't is that it's not /really/ a ghostbusters movie. to me it mostly resembles those ""don't-think-too-hard-about-it"" girl comedies where a lot of the humor comes from prolonged banter. i think a lot of the reason people like girl comedies is because it reminds them of how fun it is to screw about with their friends (at least in my case!). i think ghostbusters 2016 is fine on its own (totally mindless, but serves its purpose), but its sense of humor and style deviates so much from the original that it's a letdown. i think they at least should've marketed it as a spinoff loosely based on the original and not ""literally it is ghostbusters. it is titled 'ghostbusters' and that's what it is"" because that's...not the case"
"8288","it feels like the script was written in the manner a lot of comedy television is written - where funny people are given an opportunity to improv and be funny. except when people edit television shows together they pick the funniest takes. that's one take, out of many. they don't just... leave it all in there. ugh."
"8289","could have come, not could have came."
"8290","honnestly i saw that last part you were cutting smaller and smaller. the first time i was like yeah this isn't funny at all. the second time i was like. i guess the pacing is better. still not funny though really. then the last version that implied the she was fired, you really got a laugh out of me. good job on that one"
"8291","that editing at the end..... spot on. ^_^"
"8292","the middle finger improvised gag was the worst thing about this fucking movie"
"8293","omg the small vs far away. xd"
"8294","blaming the editors is valid, but it also implicates the writers. there wouldn't be a need to debate where a scene should end if the script contained actual thought-through jokes to begin with."
"8295","paul feig is a hack, the only good thing he's ever contributed to was freaks and geeks"
"8296","i can't remember who made it, but there's a video where someone compares american and british comedy movies, and one of the points they make is that too many american comedies are just lightly edited improv"
"8297","not seen the movie as it doesn't seem like my kinda comedy, but i'll be honest, that my cat/mike hat scene you played got an actual laugh from me. probably didn't need to continue rapid firing the jokes after that line, but having a dog with a name that sounds like my cat is weirdly hilarious to me. like, it could be a really funny and clever line in another movie/show, imagine dougal saying it."
"8298","i would have cut even earlier in ""the bird"" scene. specifically when she says ""let me guess, get out?"" i'd cut straight to them being outside."
"8299","there are a lot of valid points in this video. the movie certainly could have been edited better. but i thought it was hillarious. i prefer comedy when it is stuffed with as many jokes as possible and the mike hat joke was funny. how can you not like a word pun?"
"8300","one of the things that bothered me the most was how much pink was required to be in the movie. it seemed pretty silly to have literally every second color pink or a bright pinkish red and just pulled vision away from anything else. less is more, man."
"8301","i'm still laughing about mike hat"
"8302","i can't help but laugh whenever i see kate mckinnon. whenever i see her, i think of hillary clinton being in that situation and acting like her."
"8303","i disagree with nearly every point you made, but that slime scene wasn't even in the version of the film i saw so we clearly didn't see the same movie."
"8304","i give ghostbusters 2016 a perfect 5/7"
"8305","movie is still dogshit politics or no politics"
"8306","most of your criticisms here i think are right. that said, i absolutely love this movie. one of the first all-female action comedies i've ever seen &, honestly, that kinda overrides these structure &
character problems to me. again, you're right abt this movie, i think, but to me & all the friends i saw it with originally (all of us women), the all-female cast was more important. this movie still delights me when i rewatch it, even knowing that, sure, the movie did have a ton of problems. by no means do i think it's a masterpiece, but i think i'll keep having fun with it for at least a couple more watches."
"8307","sjw garbage"
"8308","i recall when i saw the trailers after all the hubbub i thought it looked alright. i couldn't understand the obscene hatred of it. after seeing the movie i thought.... meh. not a great movie, but it had a few moments."
"8309","i wonder if you would address the criticism of your take which says that there is a special kind of feminine humour that you're just not picking up, or else that much of the humour you find boring consists mostly of men being assholes towards women, which makes the characters more sympathetic and the situation more comedic because the target audience are ""women who think men are assholes"", which they stated explicitly in their marketing strategy. 

this also explains why it's hilarious that the male character is an idiot. he is an idiot, but he's attractive, ""just like men usually see women,"" and the more obviously idiotic he is, the more outrageous it seems that he's allowed to work there, which is a commentary on male privilege. also, i think he literally turns out to be the evil antagonist, and therefore is allowed to seem non-human?

my point is, i think this movie was supposed to be hilarious to some people, namely people who cope with what they see as an aggressively misogynist world through the use of humour. i was mostly just wondering whether it fails in this regard. 

but i think my facts are undisputed. there's a reason sony did everything they could to feed the trolls, thereby engendering a pre-release discussion presumably designed specifically to make women feel under siege, then offering the ""solace"" of a movie that was made ""just for you."" 
so, was it successful on those terms? i think a lot of the sequences you would have cut are precisely designed to reinforce the sense that the female characters are being mocked, shamed, or disrespected, including the ""michael hat"" scene. 
the only question i have is whether it was actually funny to the target audience. which is fine by me, but i pity people whose problems lead them to seek to demonize half the population."
"8310","that hearse is pretty. i'd drive that. i'd buy that."
"8311","stantz. it's german. don't look for an explanation."
"8312","one thing to remember about the original, and i'm quoting mostly from lindsay ellis here, is that it was very... reagan. they're portrayed as these plucky entrepreneurs who are private sector and good unlike the bad, bureaucratic government who wants to regulate them which is bad. 

in other words, it's everything i hate about american portrayals of private sector / public sector dynamics. it's deeply unsympathetic to the government and treats the private sector not just as heroes, but as inherently small and important and under the thumb of mean, bad, unnecessary regulation."
"8313","what killed the movie for me is too much improv"
"8314","i woulda included the ""you were right"""
"8315","more jokes =/= funny is why i couldn't enjoy thor ragnarok. well, that and the terrible pacing."
"8316","holy shit some real critique, its not just ""women are in it, i hate this"""
"8317","this analysis has real.. character"
"8318","is it bad that i like the ""mike hat"" joke?"
"8319","it was ass"
"8320","i understand your complaints. i just disagree.

also, there's some cathartic humor to hemsworth's character for women. female characters, especially in older movies, were often stupid and always making things worse. it's hyperbolic compared to some examples.... but sadly not others..."
"8321","it seems far worse than what i thought it would be. i thought it was just overblown ""feminists are ruining everything! womeeeen!!!!11"" a movie about how the production was ruined from a potentially better remake or sequel has better comedic potential, even though it would perhaps be somewhat of a rip-off of _the tv set_ (2006), in this broad aspect of the story."
"8322","what really annoyed the crap out of me was the constant dancing"
"8323","well, to be fair they were broke enough to not be able to buy the firehouse, that's why they got the place they did, and they were so broke that patty had to get them the hearse. but i can see all the problems you saw with the movie, not saying that this one thing you got wrong made the movie good. the movie still is quite flawed in many of the ways you said. i do agree, but i just wanted to say that you were missing out on this one part. but i don't really like the original movies that much either. i feel like, although the original movie was made okay, but it really didn't age well, at least not for me."
"8324","i enjoyed the movie for what it was when i saw it, but i hadn't actually seen the original so didn't have that sort of baseline.

i really want to see the shaun cut though. the other comedy clips you contrasted the film with were way funnier and your quick edits got a lot more of a laugh out of me than the sort of low level amusement i got from the original cut."
"8325","i'm a fan of melissa mccarthy's schtick of steamrolling over the gravity of the situation around her with self-centered, obsessive nonsense. it's basically the entire movie the heat, and it totally works for me. in ghostbusters, it works as long as it's just her and the cop, because it's a force of personality trampling what should be an authority figure in an inappropriate situation. then a third character jumps in and it becomes a generic ""let's all be silly together"". so yeah, that's another edit point.
i also love kate mckinnon's uncanny ability to sell zany behavior. she always looks like she's really into it, ""it"" being something utterly unfathomable to everyone else. it also makes sense than an anarchistic crank would be the kind of research assistant a disgraced ghost hunter could attract, so her eccentricity leads her to this enterprise.
i appreciate leslie jones's part more for your pointing out that she does the best job staying in character. as the one who's a blue-collar worker rather than a ghost scientist, she should be the most down-to-earth, and she is. her decision to join isn't tremendously well motivated, but i don't think we needed an explicit depiction of her obsession getting her fired. she showed up there because of her obsession, and that's enough to fit her in with the misfits.
chris hemsworth was there entirely to serve as a trope inversion. what if the implausibly sexy idiot secretary... was a man!? they knowingly sacrificed character believability to do that, and i support the goal even if a lot of his bits were more frustrating than entertaining.
i am not a fan of kristen wiig's sad wet kitten in the rain routine. her whole character is a trash bag blowing in the wind. everything she is is just a series of the worst thing happening to her. the recurring character wiig plays always tries to ingratiate herself to everyone and ends up offending the most. it's the wrong kind of awkward to be enjoyable, the kind where our protagonist was in control of it enough to easily avoid it but not such that she's actively inflicting it on bystanders or competently riding it out. it's one long ""poor me, i have no agency"" joke, and i cringe through the whole thing.
that, i think, is why i enjoyed your proposed edit tremendously. it cuts out wiig's pointlessly agonizing kick-the-dog montage and instead moves that to implied offscreen action, allowing it to motivate a confrontation where she controls the action and expresses herself. much better!"
"8326","23:12
i would have added ""you were right..."""
"8327","i also think the attitude was 'we'll get a sequel and improve things then'."
"8328","great video. i watched this on dvd recently and while i thought it was 'ok', i pretty much hit the nail on the head on everything [especially the action being a special effects fest]. i actually didn't mind holtzman antics but that's because her character is wacky, but i didn't care for any of the characters, cause as you say, they keep breaking character. but they want it both ways so you also have the holtzman speech about friends or the bit when erin rescues abby-both scenes looks for pathos and fall flat because you don't care. and completely agree with kevin being one boring joke repeated ad nausea."
"8329","i was watching the gb clips thinking 'they don't seem that bad' until the father ted clip made me (actually) laugh for a good thirty seconds. i never watched the gb remake and i'm glad, but also sad. it would have been cool to see some lady ghostbusters in a movie that gave them room to be, you know, engaging and likable and funny."
"8330","i quite liked it. had a good time. i didn't really think of it was a comedy ha-ha movie, but a semi-quirky action thing where i mostly paid attention to the ghosts, tech, colors and that one character i think is kinda hot. it's not funny like ghostbusters or hot fuzz, but still, i chuckled at times. good enough to watch

edit: holtzmann is perfect and i love her"
"8331","now, that's how you edit a movie!!!
great review, man! i loved it!"
"8332","your recut implied firing actually made me laugh"
"8333","in the original peter. ray and egon got thrown out of the university not college because they had their funding cut so the university couldn't afford the research and unit some people pray on others mistakes when they make them as well . frankie croft smales"
"8334","holtzmann is funny because she's flirting with erin, thats my only criticism. love your videos"
"8335","re-cutting the movie probably wouldn't change much, the problem with this movie is that it has no script. most of the movie is improv by actors which puts even more blame on them for shitty jokes. conversation in a restaurant took about 7 hours to film, and what they put in the movie apparently was the best footage they had. watch ralphmoviemaker's review on it."
"8336","i just discovered your videos taking cinemasins down a peg and i'm so happy i did lol you're a dope awesome critic, beyond clever and aware: side note, would it...maybe be at all possible to talk a little faster? lol i've been thinking the same thing about cinemasins for a while too lol they used to be good and actually observant, but they became tryhard douchebags after they started catering to the greatest majority of fans (for views and money) as opposed to...actually thinking about the things they write lol"
"8337","honestly, wow. your re-cuts are pretty good. especially the one where she gets fired, that would've been absolutely the right call"
"8338","that walk it was a play on the walk of shame, something that resonates with a lot of women because they are often shamed in life. i don't think a man can really find this funny, i didn't, my wife did though, and we've been together since we were 19, so not like it hit home.but women are often publicly shamed for no reason and deliberate denial in the face of shaming is funny, especially when the shame is undeniable. but yeah it was  mediocre."
"8339","it isn't very funny. why are people making excuses."
"8340","the problem with mediocre jokes stretched to no end is what i have in every scary movie movie since part 2 and all following ripoffs like fantastic movie, date movie and whatever sequels there were.
a few good jokes and many lame jokes stretched to a point where you only wish for a scene to finally end.

bad editing at its worst. i fully agree that the ghost busters remake could have made way better.

stretch a joke too much and it just becomes very awkward to sit through. and awkward humor might work in a jim carrey movie or the wayne's world movies. 
they depend on it and viewers know what they get. it depends on unique, charismatic and crazy characters to deliver it in just the right dosis.

but it certainly doesn't work in normal comedy movies."
"8341","not going to lie.. it's a bad sign for a comedy movie when some random youtuber's edited version actually makes you laugh :d i legit cracked a smile during the ""suck it"" part and the whole ""getting fired"" bit cutting off at charles dance doing this stern sigh and her going ""who's thaaaat?"" made me burst out loud.

now i wish there was a shorter, funny cut of the film."
"8342","i agree with a lot of what you say here, but i do have one little nitpick: when talking about the ways in which dialogue ruins the comedy in the movie, you use the example of the proton pack being turned on for the first time arguing that if melissa mccarthy weren't talking the joke would have landed, like it did in the original. i think you're right that it doesn't land, but i think that it's in the direction and staging, rather than the dialogue or lack thereof. in the original, all parties involved are present in one shot, so the turning on of the machine and subsequent backing away are one continuous ""thought"". set up and punchline in one spot. there's also the visual gag that they're in an elevator so the space is enclosed and there's nowhere really for egon to back away to. on top of that there's the layer that they're in the field, about to use this technology which egon presumably designed that he now, just before using it in a public place, is unsure of. in the new one, all of those layers are stripped away. it's a test, nobody knows if it'll work so backing away is reasonable. they're outside, so there's plenty of space to back away. the two shot set up has no eye-trace, that is, melissa mccarthy is the single subject of one shot and the reaction cuts to dual focus in a relatively different part of the screen, leaving the viewer scrambling for a visual anchor while they miss the joke. you could be right that if all of that was fixed mccarthy's line could still blow the joke, but i think there's sort of a magnum opus of directional failure getting in the way of that being a conclusive reason for it. wow that was way longer than i thought it would be when i started typing."
"8343","the rating at the end killed me."
"8344","gattaca"
"8345","the biggest problem i find with this movie is that they have a good joke followed with a bad one. like the one with dan as a taxi driver. he spouts all lot of knowledge about ghosts and then follows it with ""i believe in no ghosts""
i thought is was very okay. wouldn't seek it out but it if would be on i might stay for a watch."
"8346","all the jokes you showed as examples of what are bad jokes made me laugh out loud having not seen the movie so i might just be dumb"
"8347","stuck to his own premise. kudos. made me chuckle."
"8348","i personally loved the movie"
"8349","spooktacular!"
"8350","i feel like every scene of this movie is a scene ive seen elsewhere done properly. like the flipping the bird scene was totally not at all like that bruce almighty scene. dont know if you bring that one up yet but omg this movie gives me terminal cancer"
"8351","kevin's character isn't just he's stupid, it that he stupid and beefcake."
"8352","funny--i thought holzman was the best part of the movie, and the mismatch came from wiig's style of humor not really ""fitting"". of course, being a socially stunted anxiety-ridden shy kid, cracking jokes and being weird like holzman is precisely how i deal with people in the real world--so seeing that represented was great. and her bit at the end cemented her character for me."
"8353","it sounds like a lot of this comes down to american vs british humor. a lot of americans like more obvious humor, if that makes any sense."
"8354","""small....far awayyy..."" 😂😂😂"
"8355","on an aside, charles dance is amazing, especially when it comes to 'modern speak' played with disdain. just look at all the big fat quiz segments with him in it, where he reads autobiographies from young weirdos"
"8356","brilliant. especially your modified/reedited scenes were way better than the original."
"8357","not a huge fan about this particular movie, but i did have a question about mel brooks films.  he's one of my top 5 directors, and he had the opposite opinion on comedy editing than you have just proposed.  he believed and i'm paraphrasing here, to machine gun in gags and jokes into every scene.  if the verbal joke fails to land than the physical one may keep the audience entertained, his theory is that if you fill the script/screen with enough jokes all the time, at least 1 will land per scene.  he approached his comedy like a shotgun, trying to hit every demographics funny button, so the low brow slap stick will work for group x, the racy humor will work for y and the pitter patter dialogue will work for z, while the puns may work for group w and so on.  do you like his films?  or is it that the flaw of ghost busters was that it's humor wasn't shotgun so much as a rifle and they just keep firing in the same spot over and over and over again.  

mind you i did not find the movie terrible, just...  not good.  i wish gb3's original script or the 3rd script could have been used, i find the lack of baton toss and the overall all ""reboot"" nature of this is very detrimental to the series...  it made me go in ""on defense"" rather than being able to enjoy the movie on it's own merit.  it forced me to view it as an alternative competition to what i love, rather than a continuation (or even a lovely spinoff) of what i love.  it rubbed me the wrong way."
"8358","i am now a fan of shaun... incidentally, having never seen the movie, i feel slightly embarrassed to admit that i found the 'michael hat' joke funny."
"8359","it seems like they didn't actually write any jokey jokes, they just let them talk. like, they never shut up. someone's always commenting. always yelling. it's noisy and crowded with speech that has no purpose (well i believe the original purpose is comedy but it doesn't work.). to me this movie is the equivalent of the guy in your class who thinks he's funny, so he keeps talking while everyone else is talking. and he keeps getting louder. or the dad who thinks he's funny and he keeps trying to tell jokey jokes. and both butt into other conversations, stopping them and just keep talking to look for the joke!!!"
"8360","wow you edit better than sony"
"8361","brilliant work."
"8362","i quite liked the ""mike hat""-line."
"8363","i bet i was laughing more about this review than i would aout the film"
"8364","sometimes, less is more."
"8365","15:30 we need to talk about kevin"
"8366","still better than ghost busters 2"
"8367","pretty good video until you said the movie isn't funny because women aren't funny... kinda killed it"
"8368","if you think bombs are so funny why didn't you think the movie was funny? ohhh! and now my serious bit; it was indeed edited for shit, patti was fired and that was in the first draft script (nailed it shaun!), holtzmann had a whole explaining why she uses applied sciences to find ghosts, and the whole thing with bill murray had every plot relevant dialogue cut to make way for the goofeyness. they did this because kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy made their entire career on unfunny drawn out awkwardness, and it sucks paul feig let those two just reuse their old shitty style make the movie terrible. ivan rietman should have stepped in and said, ""i understand this came from snl people originally, and the sentiment of having your snl brand of humor prevalent is important to recognize, but this isn't a 4 minute skit.""  but he didn't because he himself uses drawn out gags as the premise for his mediocre movies. they also could have done better with one loud character instead of 16, i like leslie jones' style of stating something loud and proud and then ending on the ""i might be wrong about some of that."" note. but anything that patti said humorously was almost immediately out-shouted by abby. shaun, you need to edit some of these movies, i agree with you that it would be a better film, and from the comments i've read here, so does everyone else."
"8369","least your criticism of the film is not the typical 'sjw this' or 'feminists that'."
"8370","alternate title for this vid: the desperate search for a sliver lining of one of the worst cash-grab piece-of-shit films ever made.
keep searching you fucking cuck."
"8371","that ending caught me off guard and it was great."
"8372","i had a pretty good time at the  ""suck it"" scene, but only as far as the ""suck it"" part."
"8373","wait. where exactly are you from shaun?! i always struggled placing you from your accent, but that father ted thing, hui! don't tell me you are from the wesht!"
"8374","1:22 why does controversy annoys you? based on your videos you would probably never do video on this movie if there was no controversy."
"8375","an interesting rumour i heard about this was the script writer had to disown the work as about 90% of the script didn't get into the film. all the nonsense about anti irish fencing and the likes was ad-libed and paul fiege was don't right bad at reigning in the actors when they went off script so there's not just minutes but hours of unused footage for the entire film.

to put this into comparison, though across some genre lines. david lynch and stanley kubrick have been known to film the same scene over a hundred times to get dialogue and reactions that fit perfectly. numerous times the actors said the exact phrase with minor or occasional changes. paul feige on the other hand filmed scene's and just forgot to say cut when the scene was over because he was hoping the film would write itself and the editor would know what to keep and what to dismiss.

i've not had the courage to read it myself, because the film lost me at the first queef joke and i barely made it to past the concert before i turned it off... but just think if you were the writer of a decent script and it turned out like this."
"8376","i've spent a long time puzzling over how this happened. the interesting thing about the editing is that it was edited by brent white, who also edited basically every good judd apatow movie. and in fact, i would go so far as to say that paul feig was _trying_ to make an apatow movie. apatow's movies are, like ghostbusters, produced by gathering a large amount of largely improvisational content, and then stitching it into a cohesive movie. and that process is obviously heavily reliant on a great editor. but it's also dependent on a good director.

so while it does superficially seem like the movie's problems are largely a matter of editing, i'm more tempted to blame the direction. i don't think feig knew how to get good raw material out of his actors. i don't think he got any footage of them _not_ talking. so as you said, the ideal cut would only be forty minutes long (i think that might be generous), which probably would have upset the studio. and even then, almost all of the jokes would still have been weak; they just wouldn't be _painful_."
"8377","the problem incessant rambling of improvised bits is not limited to this movie. i feel like it has sunk a number of recent comedies, i've seen. as an actor, i can tell you i've been on many a set where the director at some point says, ""let's do a couple improv takes."" most struggling actors in hollywood are told to take improv classes when not working. i, myself, have been in an improv group. i think there is more to acting than just being able to improvise.there is certainly more to making a movie than filming actors improvising and just putting all on screen as you very rightly show with your editing examples. i love your work shaun. keep going. please."
"8378","well, now the world knows that hemsworth is actually very funny."
"8379","no! ya gotta include the ""oh , you were right."" after ""suck. it."" before the cut! that was the real tag! come on!"
"8380","ahahahah the end bit"
"8381","i think it was a really bad film. i mean really, really bad. but the worst movie ever made? no way. i watch so many films that were far worse, this one doesn't even comes close."
"8382","i think some of the unfunny scenes weren't even in the script. i heard somewhere, that there was a lot of adlib-ing on the set. the ""mike hat"" sounds like exactly the kind of joke, an actor would improvise on a bad day.

oh, also ""father ted"" is simply wonderful. one of my favorite britcoms."
"8383","i think they were trying to imitate judd appatow."
"8384","for the ""suck it"" scene, i would've cut it right after whatsherfuck says ""you were right"". they started the little ""bet"" thing when mccarthy guessed what the dean would say and i personally think it's funnier to see that to completion"
"8385","your cuts are really good dude"
"8386","yeah, i saw this today and majority of the movie fell flat for me. it had 1 high point, but the ending was underwhelming."
"8387","honestly, i did enjoy this movie, but i think the reason many didn't is that it's not /really/ a ghostbusters movie. to me it mostly resembles those ""don't-think-too-hard-about-it"" girl comedies where a lot of the humor comes from prolonged banter. i think a lot of the reason people like girl comedies is because it reminds them of how fun it is to screw about with their friends (at least in my case!). i think ghostbusters 2016 is fine on its own (totally mindless, but serves its purpose), but its sense of humor and style deviates so much from the original that it's a letdown. i think they at least should've marketed it as a spinoff loosely based on the original and not ""literally it is ghostbusters. it is titled 'ghostbusters' and that's what it is"" because that's...not the case"
"8388","it feels like the script was written in the manner a lot of comedy television is written - where funny people are given an opportunity to improv and be funny. except when people edit television shows together they pick the funniest takes. that's one take, out of many. they don't just... leave it all in there. ugh."
"8389","could have come, not could have came."
"8390","honnestly i saw that last part you were cutting smaller and smaller. the first time i was like yeah this isn't funny at all. the second time i was like. i guess the pacing is better. still not funny though really. then the last version that implied the she was fired, you really got a laugh out of me. good job on that one"
"8391","that editing at the end..... spot on. ^_^"
"8392","the middle finger improvised gag was the worst thing about this fucking movie"
"8393","omg the small vs far away. xd"
"8394","blaming the editors is valid, but it also implicates the writers. there wouldn't be a need to debate where a scene should end if the script contained actual thought-through jokes to begin with."
"8395","paul feig is a hack, the only good thing he's ever contributed to was freaks and geeks"
"8396","i can't remember who made it, but there's a video where someone compares american and british comedy movies, and one of the points they make is that too many american comedies are just lightly edited improv"
"8397","not seen the movie as it doesn't seem like my kinda comedy, but i'll be honest, that my cat/mike hat scene you played got an actual laugh from me. probably didn't need to continue rapid firing the jokes after that line, but having a dog with a name that sounds like my cat is weirdly hilarious to me. like, it could be a really funny and clever line in another movie/show, imagine dougal saying it."
"8398","i would have cut even earlier in ""the bird"" scene. specifically when she says ""let me guess, get out?"" i'd cut straight to them being outside."
"8399","there are a lot of valid points in this video. the movie certainly could have been edited better. but i thought it was hillarious. i prefer comedy when it is stuffed with as many jokes as possible and the mike hat joke was funny. how can you not like a word pun?"
"8400","one of the things that bothered me the most was how much pink was required to be in the movie. it seemed pretty silly to have literally every second color pink or a bright pinkish red and just pulled vision away from anything else. less is more, man."
"8401","i'm still laughing about mike hat"
"8402","i can't help but laugh whenever i see kate mckinnon. whenever i see her, i think of hillary clinton being in that situation and acting like her."
"8403","i disagree with nearly every point you made, but that slime scene wasn't even in the version of the film i saw so we clearly didn't see the same movie."
"8404","i give ghostbusters 2016 a perfect 5/7"
"8405","movie is still dogshit politics or no politics"
"8406","most of your criticisms here i think are right. that said, i absolutely love this movie. one of the first all-female action comedies i've ever seen &, honestly, that kinda overrides these structure &
character problems to me. again, you're right abt this movie, i think, but to me & all the friends i saw it with originally (all of us women), the all-female cast was more important. this movie still delights me when i rewatch it, even knowing that, sure, the movie did have a ton of problems. by no means do i think it's a masterpiece, but i think i'll keep having fun with it for at least a couple more watches."
"8407","sjw garbage"
"8408","i recall when i saw the trailers after all the hubbub i thought it looked alright. i couldn't understand the obscene hatred of it. after seeing the movie i thought.... meh. not a great movie, but it had a few moments."
"8409","i wonder if you would address the criticism of your take which says that there is a special kind of feminine humour that you're just not picking up, or else that much of the humour you find boring consists mostly of men being assholes towards women, which makes the characters more sympathetic and the situation more comedic because the target audience are ""women who think men are assholes"", which they stated explicitly in their marketing strategy. 

this also explains why it's hilarious that the male character is an idiot. he is an idiot, but he's attractive, ""just like men usually see women,"" and the more obviously idiotic he is, the more outrageous it seems that he's allowed to work there, which is a commentary on male privilege. also, i think he literally turns out to be the evil antagonist, and therefore is allowed to seem non-human?

my point is, i think this movie was supposed to be hilarious to some people, namely people who cope with what they see as an aggressively misogynist world through the use of humour. i was mostly just wondering whether it fails in this regard. 

but i think my facts are undisputed. there's a reason sony did everything they could to feed the trolls, thereby engendering a pre-release discussion presumably designed specifically to make women feel under siege, then offering the ""solace"" of a movie that was made ""just for you."" 
so, was it successful on those terms? i think a lot of the sequences you would have cut are precisely designed to reinforce the sense that the female characters are being mocked, shamed, or disrespected, including the ""michael hat"" scene. 
the only question i have is whether it was actually funny to the target audience. which is fine by me, but i pity people whose problems lead them to seek to demonize half the population."
"8410","that hearse is pretty. i'd drive that. i'd buy that."
"8411","stantz. it's german. don't look for an explanation."
"8412","one thing to remember about the original, and i'm quoting mostly from lindsay ellis here, is that it was very... reagan. they're portrayed as these plucky entrepreneurs who are private sector and good unlike the bad, bureaucratic government who wants to regulate them which is bad. 

in other words, it's everything i hate about american portrayals of private sector / public sector dynamics. it's deeply unsympathetic to the government and treats the private sector not just as heroes, but as inherently small and important and under the thumb of mean, bad, unnecessary regulation."
"8413","what killed the movie for me is too much improv"
"8414","i woulda included the ""you were right"""
"8415","more jokes =/= funny is why i couldn't enjoy thor ragnarok. well, that and the terrible pacing."
"8416","holy shit some real critique, its not just ""women are in it, i hate this"""
"8417","this analysis has real.. character"
"8418","is it bad that i like the ""mike hat"" joke?"
"8419","it was ass"
"8420","i understand your complaints. i just disagree.

also, there's some cathartic humor to hemsworth's character for women. female characters, especially in older movies, were often stupid and always making things worse. it's hyperbolic compared to some examples.... but sadly not others..."
"8421","it seems far worse than what i thought it would be. i thought it was just overblown ""feminists are ruining everything! womeeeen!!!!11"" a movie about how the production was ruined from a potentially better remake or sequel has better comedic potential, even though it would perhaps be somewhat of a rip-off of _the tv set_ (2006), in this broad aspect of the story."
"8422","what really annoyed the crap out of me was the constant dancing"
"8423","well, to be fair they were broke enough to not be able to buy the firehouse, that's why they got the place they did, and they were so broke that patty had to get them the hearse. but i can see all the problems you saw with the movie, not saying that this one thing you got wrong made the movie good. the movie still is quite flawed in many of the ways you said. i do agree, but i just wanted to say that you were missing out on this one part. but i don't really like the original movies that much either. i feel like, although the original movie was made okay, but it really didn't age well, at least not for me."
"8424","i enjoyed the movie for what it was when i saw it, but i hadn't actually seen the original so didn't have that sort of baseline.

i really want to see the shaun cut though. the other comedy clips you contrasted the film with were way funnier and your quick edits got a lot more of a laugh out of me than the sort of low level amusement i got from the original cut."
"8425","i'm a fan of melissa mccarthy's schtick of steamrolling over the gravity of the situation around her with self-centered, obsessive nonsense. it's basically the entire movie the heat, and it totally works for me. in ghostbusters, it works as long as it's just her and the cop, because it's a force of personality trampling what should be an authority figure in an inappropriate situation. then a third character jumps in and it becomes a generic ""let's all be silly together"". so yeah, that's another edit point.
i also love kate mckinnon's uncanny ability to sell zany behavior. she always looks like she's really into it, ""it"" being something utterly unfathomable to everyone else. it also makes sense than an anarchistic crank would be the kind of research assistant a disgraced ghost hunter could attract, so her eccentricity leads her to this enterprise.
i appreciate leslie jones's part more for your pointing out that she does the best job staying in character. as the one who's a blue-collar worker rather than a ghost scientist, she should be the most down-to-earth, and she is. her decision to join isn't tremendously well motivated, but i don't think we needed an explicit depiction of her obsession getting her fired. she showed up there because of her obsession, and that's enough to fit her in with the misfits.
chris hemsworth was there entirely to serve as a trope inversion. what if the implausibly sexy idiot secretary... was a man!? they knowingly sacrificed character believability to do that, and i support the goal even if a lot of his bits were more frustrating than entertaining.
i am not a fan of kristen wiig's sad wet kitten in the rain routine. her whole character is a trash bag blowing in the wind. everything she is is just a series of the worst thing happening to her. the recurring character wiig plays always tries to ingratiate herself to everyone and ends up offending the most. it's the wrong kind of awkward to be enjoyable, the kind where our protagonist was in control of it enough to easily avoid it but not such that she's actively inflicting it on bystanders or competently riding it out. it's one long ""poor me, i have no agency"" joke, and i cringe through the whole thing.
that, i think, is why i enjoyed your proposed edit tremendously. it cuts out wiig's pointlessly agonizing kick-the-dog montage and instead moves that to implied offscreen action, allowing it to motivate a confrontation where she controls the action and expresses herself. much better!"
"8426","23:12
i would have added ""you were right..."""
"8427","i also think the attitude was 'we'll get a sequel and improve things then'."
"8428","great video. i watched this on dvd recently and while i thought it was 'ok', i pretty much hit the nail on the head on everything [especially the action being a special effects fest]. i actually didn't mind holtzman antics but that's because her character is wacky, but i didn't care for any of the characters, cause as you say, they keep breaking character. but they want it both ways so you also have the holtzman speech about friends or the bit when erin rescues abby-both scenes looks for pathos and fall flat because you don't care. and completely agree with kevin being one boring joke repeated ad nausea."
"8429","i was watching the gb clips thinking 'they don't seem that bad' until the father ted clip made me (actually) laugh for a good thirty seconds. i never watched the gb remake and i'm glad, but also sad. it would have been cool to see some lady ghostbusters in a movie that gave them room to be, you know, engaging and likable and funny."
"8430","i quite liked it. had a good time. i didn't really think of it was a comedy ha-ha movie, but a semi-quirky action thing where i mostly paid attention to the ghosts, tech, colors and that one character i think is kinda hot. it's not funny like ghostbusters or hot fuzz, but still, i chuckled at times. good enough to watch

edit: holtzmann is perfect and i love her"
"8431","now, that's how you edit a movie!!!
great review, man! i loved it!"
"8432","your recut implied firing actually made me laugh"
"8433","in the original peter. ray and egon got thrown out of the university not college because they had their funding cut so the university couldn't afford the research and unit some people pray on others mistakes when they make them as well . frankie croft smales"
"8434","holtzmann is funny because she's flirting with erin, thats my only criticism. love your videos"
"8435","re-cutting the movie probably wouldn't change much, the problem with this movie is that it has no script. most of the movie is improv by actors which puts even more blame on them for shitty jokes. conversation in a restaurant took about 7 hours to film, and what they put in the movie apparently was the best footage they had. watch ralphmoviemaker's review on it."
"8436","i just discovered your videos taking cinemasins down a peg and i'm so happy i did lol you're a dope awesome critic, beyond clever and aware: side note, would it...maybe be at all possible to talk a little faster? lol i've been thinking the same thing about cinemasins for a while too lol they used to be good and actually observant, but they became tryhard douchebags after they started catering to the greatest majority of fans (for views and money) as opposed to...actually thinking about the things they write lol"
"8437","honestly, wow. your re-cuts are pretty good. especially the one where she gets fired, that would've been absolutely the right call"
"8438","that walk it was a play on the walk of shame, something that resonates with a lot of women because they are often shamed in life. i don't think a man can really find this funny, i didn't, my wife did though, and we've been together since we were 19, so not like it hit home.but women are often publicly shamed for no reason and deliberate denial in the face of shaming is funny, especially when the shame is undeniable. but yeah it was  mediocre."
"8439","it isn't very funny. why are people making excuses."
"8440","the problem with mediocre jokes stretched to no end is what i have in every scary movie movie since part 2 and all following ripoffs like fantastic movie, date movie and whatever sequels there were.
a few good jokes and many lame jokes stretched to a point where you only wish for a scene to finally end.

bad editing at its worst. i fully agree that the ghost busters remake could have made way better.

stretch a joke too much and it just becomes very awkward to sit through. and awkward humor might work in a jim carrey movie or the wayne's world movies. 
they depend on it and viewers know what they get. it depends on unique, charismatic and crazy characters to deliver it in just the right dosis.

but it certainly doesn't work in normal comedy movies."
"8441","not going to lie.. it's a bad sign for a comedy movie when some random youtuber's edited version actually makes you laugh :d i legit cracked a smile during the ""suck it"" part and the whole ""getting fired"" bit cutting off at charles dance doing this stern sigh and her going ""who's thaaaat?"" made me burst out loud.

now i wish there was a shorter, funny cut of the film."
"8442","i agree with a lot of what you say here, but i do have one little nitpick: when talking about the ways in which dialogue ruins the comedy in the movie, you use the example of the proton pack being turned on for the first time arguing that if melissa mccarthy weren't talking the joke would have landed, like it did in the original. i think you're right that it doesn't land, but i think that it's in the direction and staging, rather than the dialogue or lack thereof. in the original, all parties involved are present in one shot, so the turning on of the machine and subsequent backing away are one continuous ""thought"". set up and punchline in one spot. there's also the visual gag that they're in an elevator so the space is enclosed and there's nowhere really for egon to back away to. on top of that there's the layer that they're in the field, about to use this technology which egon presumably designed that he now, just before using it in a public place, is unsure of. in the new one, all of those layers are stripped away. it's a test, nobody knows if it'll work so backing away is reasonable. they're outside, so there's plenty of space to back away. the two shot set up has no eye-trace, that is, melissa mccarthy is the single subject of one shot and the reaction cuts to dual focus in a relatively different part of the screen, leaving the viewer scrambling for a visual anchor while they miss the joke. you could be right that if all of that was fixed mccarthy's line could still blow the joke, but i think there's sort of a magnum opus of directional failure getting in the way of that being a conclusive reason for it. wow that was way longer than i thought it would be when i started typing."
"8443","the rating at the end killed me."
"8444","gattaca"
"8445","the biggest problem i find with this movie is that they have a good joke followed with a bad one. like the one with dan as a taxi driver. he spouts all lot of knowledge about ghosts and then follows it with ""i believe in no ghosts""
i thought is was very okay. wouldn't seek it out but it if would be on i might stay for a watch."
"8446","all the jokes you showed as examples of what are bad jokes made me laugh out loud having not seen the movie so i might just be dumb"
"8447","stuck to his own premise. kudos. made me chuckle."
"8448","i personally loved the movie"
"8449","spooktacular!"
"8450","i feel like every scene of this movie is a scene ive seen elsewhere done properly. like the flipping the bird scene was totally not at all like that bruce almighty scene. dont know if you bring that one up yet but omg this movie gives me terminal cancer"
"8451","kevin's character isn't just he's stupid, it that he stupid and beefcake."
"8452","funny--i thought holzman was the best part of the movie, and the mismatch came from wiig's style of humor not really ""fitting"". of course, being a socially stunted anxiety-ridden shy kid, cracking jokes and being weird like holzman is precisely how i deal with people in the real world--so seeing that represented was great. and her bit at the end cemented her character for me."
"8453","it sounds like a lot of this comes down to american vs british humor. a lot of americans like more obvious humor, if that makes any sense."
"8454","""small....far awayyy..."" 😂😂😂"
"8455","on an aside, charles dance is amazing, especially when it comes to 'modern speak' played with disdain. just look at all the big fat quiz segments with him in it, where he reads autobiographies from young weirdos"
"8456","brilliant. especially your modified/reedited scenes were way better than the original."
"8457","not a huge fan about this particular movie, but i did have a question about mel brooks films.  he's one of my top 5 directors, and he had the opposite opinion on comedy editing than you have just proposed.  he believed and i'm paraphrasing here, to machine gun in gags and jokes into every scene.  if the verbal joke fails to land than the physical one may keep the audience entertained, his theory is that if you fill the script/screen with enough jokes all the time, at least 1 will land per scene.  he approached his comedy like a shotgun, trying to hit every demographics funny button, so the low brow slap stick will work for group x, the racy humor will work for y and the pitter patter dialogue will work for z, while the puns may work for group w and so on.  do you like his films?  or is it that the flaw of ghost busters was that it's humor wasn't shotgun so much as a rifle and they just keep firing in the same spot over and over and over again.  

mind you i did not find the movie terrible, just...  not good.  i wish gb3's original script or the 3rd script could have been used, i find the lack of baton toss and the overall all ""reboot"" nature of this is very detrimental to the series...  it made me go in ""on defense"" rather than being able to enjoy the movie on it's own merit.  it forced me to view it as an alternative competition to what i love, rather than a continuation (or even a lovely spinoff) of what i love.  it rubbed me the wrong way."
"8458","i am now a fan of shaun... incidentally, having never seen the movie, i feel slightly embarrassed to admit that i found the 'michael hat' joke funny."
"8459","it seems like they didn't actually write any jokey jokes, they just let them talk. like, they never shut up. someone's always commenting. always yelling. it's noisy and crowded with speech that has no purpose (well i believe the original purpose is comedy but it doesn't work.). to me this movie is the equivalent of the guy in your class who thinks he's funny, so he keeps talking while everyone else is talking. and he keeps getting louder. or the dad who thinks he's funny and he keeps trying to tell jokey jokes. and both butt into other conversations, stopping them and just keep talking to look for the joke!!!"
"8460","wow you edit better than sony"
"8461","brilliant work."
"8462","i quite liked the ""mike hat""-line."
"8463","i bet i was laughing more about this review than i would aout the film"
"8464","sometimes, less is more."
"8465","15:30 we need to talk about kevin"
"8466","still better than ghost busters 2"
"8467","pretty good video until you said the movie isn't funny because women aren't funny... kinda killed it"
"8468","if you think bombs are so funny why didn't you think the movie was funny? ohhh! and now my serious bit; it was indeed edited for shit, patti was fired and that was in the first draft script (nailed it shaun!), holtzmann had a whole explaining why she uses applied sciences to find ghosts, and the whole thing with bill murray had every plot relevant dialogue cut to make way for the goofeyness. they did this because kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy made their entire career on unfunny drawn out awkwardness, and it sucks paul feig let those two just reuse their old shitty style make the movie terrible. ivan rietman should have stepped in and said, ""i understand this came from snl people originally, and the sentiment of having your snl brand of humor prevalent is important to recognize, but this isn't a 4 minute skit.""  but he didn't because he himself uses drawn out gags as the premise for his mediocre movies. they also could have done better with one loud character instead of 16, i like leslie jones' style of stating something loud and proud and then ending on the ""i might be wrong about some of that."" note. but anything that patti said humorously was almost immediately out-shouted by abby. shaun, you need to edit some of these movies, i agree with you that it would be a better film, and from the comments i've read here, so does everyone else."
"8469","least your criticism of the film is not the typical 'sjw this' or 'feminists that'."
"8470","alternate title for this vid: the desperate search for a sliver lining of one of the worst cash-grab piece-of-shit films ever made.
keep searching you fucking cuck."
"8471","that ending caught me off guard and it was great."
"8472","i had a pretty good time at the  ""suck it"" scene, but only as far as the ""suck it"" part."
"8473","wait. where exactly are you from shaun?! i always struggled placing you from your accent, but that father ted thing, hui! don't tell me you are from the wesht!"
"8474","1:22 why does controversy annoys you? based on your videos you would probably never do video on this movie if there was no controversy."
"8475","an interesting rumour i heard about this was the script writer had to disown the work as about 90% of the script didn't get into the film. all the nonsense about anti irish fencing and the likes was ad-libed and paul fiege was don't right bad at reigning in the actors when they went off script so there's not just minutes but hours of unused footage for the entire film.

to put this into comparison, though across some genre lines. david lynch and stanley kubrick have been known to film the same scene over a hundred times to get dialogue and reactions that fit perfectly. numerous times the actors said the exact phrase with minor or occasional changes. paul feige on the other hand filmed scene's and just forgot to say cut when the scene was over because he was hoping the film would write itself and the editor would know what to keep and what to dismiss.

i've not had the courage to read it myself, because the film lost me at the first queef joke and i barely made it to past the concert before i turned it off... but just think if you were the writer of a decent script and it turned out like this."
"8476","i've spent a long time puzzling over how this happened. the interesting thing about the editing is that it was edited by brent white, who also edited basically every good judd apatow movie. and in fact, i would go so far as to say that paul feig was _trying_ to make an apatow movie. apatow's movies are, like ghostbusters, produced by gathering a large amount of largely improvisational content, and then stitching it into a cohesive movie. and that process is obviously heavily reliant on a great editor. but it's also dependent on a good director.

so while it does superficially seem like the movie's problems are largely a matter of editing, i'm more tempted to blame the direction. i don't think feig knew how to get good raw material out of his actors. i don't think he got any footage of them _not_ talking. so as you said, the ideal cut would only be forty minutes long (i think that might be generous), which probably would have upset the studio. and even then, almost all of the jokes would still have been weak; they just wouldn't be _painful_."
"8477","the problem incessant rambling of improvised bits is not limited to this movie. i feel like it has sunk a number of recent comedies, i've seen. as an actor, i can tell you i've been on many a set where the director at some point says, ""let's do a couple improv takes."" most struggling actors in hollywood are told to take improv classes when not working. i, myself, have been in an improv group. i think there is more to acting than just being able to improvise.there is certainly more to making a movie than filming actors improvising and just putting all on screen as you very rightly show with your editing examples. i love your work shaun. keep going. please."
"8478","well, now the world knows that hemsworth is actually very funny."
"8479","no! ya gotta include the ""oh , you were right."" after ""suck. it."" before the cut! that was the real tag! come on!"
"8480","ahahahah the end bit"
"8481","i think it was a really bad film. i mean really, really bad. but the worst movie ever made? no way. i watch so many films that were far worse, this one doesn't even comes close."
"8482","i think some of the unfunny scenes weren't even in the script. i heard somewhere, that there was a lot of adlib-ing on the set. the ""mike hat"" sounds like exactly the kind of joke, an actor would improvise on a bad day.

oh, also ""father ted"" is simply wonderful. one of my favorite britcoms."
"8483","i think they were trying to imitate judd appatow."
"8484","for the ""suck it"" scene, i would've cut it right after whatsherfuck says ""you were right"". they started the little ""bet"" thing when mccarthy guessed what the dean would say and i personally think it's funnier to see that to completion"
"8485","your cuts are really good dude"
"8486","yeah, i saw this today and majority of the movie fell flat for me. it had 1 high point, but the ending was underwhelming."
"8487","honestly, i did enjoy this movie, but i think the reason many didn't is that it's not /really/ a ghostbusters movie. to me it mostly resembles those ""don't-think-too-hard-about-it"" girl comedies where a lot of the humor comes from prolonged banter. i think a lot of the reason people like girl comedies is because it reminds them of how fun it is to screw about with their friends (at least in my case!). i think ghostbusters 2016 is fine on its own (totally mindless, but serves its purpose), but its sense of humor and style deviates so much from the original that it's a letdown. i think they at least should've marketed it as a spinoff loosely based on the original and not ""literally it is ghostbusters. it is titled 'ghostbusters' and that's what it is"" because that's...not the case"
"8488","it feels like the script was written in the manner a lot of comedy television is written - where funny people are given an opportunity to improv and be funny. except when people edit television shows together they pick the funniest takes. that's one take, out of many. they don't just... leave it all in there. ugh."
"8489","could have come, not could have came."
"8490","honnestly i saw that last part you were cutting smaller and smaller. the first time i was like yeah this isn't funny at all. the second time i was like. i guess the pacing is better. still not funny though really. then the last version that implied the she was fired, you really got a laugh out of me. good job on that one"
"8491","that editing at the end..... spot on. ^_^"
"8492","the middle finger improvised gag was the worst thing about this fucking movie"
"8493","omg the small vs far away. xd"
"8494","blaming the editors is valid, but it also implicates the writers. there wouldn't be a need to debate where a scene should end if the script contained actual thought-through jokes to begin with."
"8495","paul feig is a hack, the only good thing he's ever contributed to was freaks and geeks"
"8496","i can't remember who made it, but there's a video where someone compares american and british comedy movies, and one of the points they make is that too many american comedies are just lightly edited improv"
"8497","not seen the movie as it doesn't seem like my kinda comedy, but i'll be honest, that my cat/mike hat scene you played got an actual laugh from me. probably didn't need to continue rapid firing the jokes after that line, but having a dog with a name that sounds like my cat is weirdly hilarious to me. like, it could be a really funny and clever line in another movie/show, imagine dougal saying it."
"8498","i would have cut even earlier in ""the bird"" scene. specifically when she says ""let me guess, get out?"" i'd cut straight to them being outside."
"8499","there are a lot of valid points in this video. the movie certainly could have been edited better. but i thought it was hillarious. i prefer comedy when it is stuffed with as many jokes as possible and the mike hat joke was funny. how can you not like a word pun?"
"8500","one of the things that bothered me the most was how much pink was required to be in the movie. it seemed pretty silly to have literally every second color pink or a bright pinkish red and just pulled vision away from anything else. less is more, man."
"8501","i'm still laughing about mike hat"
"8502","i can't help but laugh whenever i see kate mckinnon. whenever i see her, i think of hillary clinton being in that situation and acting like her."
"8503","i disagree with nearly every point you made, but that slime scene wasn't even in the version of the film i saw so we clearly didn't see the same movie."
"8504","i give ghostbusters 2016 a perfect 5/7"
"8505","movie is still dogshit politics or no politics"
"8506","most of your criticisms here i think are right. that said, i absolutely love this movie. one of the first all-female action comedies i've ever seen &, honestly, that kinda overrides these structure &
character problems to me. again, you're right abt this movie, i think, but to me & all the friends i saw it with originally (all of us women), the all-female cast was more important. this movie still delights me when i rewatch it, even knowing that, sure, the movie did have a ton of problems. by no means do i think it's a masterpiece, but i think i'll keep having fun with it for at least a couple more watches."
"8507","sjw garbage"
"8508","i recall when i saw the trailers after all the hubbub i thought it looked alright. i couldn't understand the obscene hatred of it. after seeing the movie i thought.... meh. not a great movie, but it had a few moments."
"8509","i wonder if you would address the criticism of your take which says that there is a special kind of feminine humour that you're just not picking up, or else that much of the humour you find boring consists mostly of men being assholes towards women, which makes the characters more sympathetic and the situation more comedic because the target audience are ""women who think men are assholes"", which they stated explicitly in their marketing strategy. 

this also explains why it's hilarious that the male character is an idiot. he is an idiot, but he's attractive, ""just like men usually see women,"" and the more obviously idiotic he is, the more outrageous it seems that he's allowed to work there, which is a commentary on male privilege. also, i think he literally turns out to be the evil antagonist, and therefore is allowed to seem non-human?

my point is, i think this movie was supposed to be hilarious to some people, namely people who cope with what they see as an aggressively misogynist world through the use of humour. i was mostly just wondering whether it fails in this regard. 

but i think my facts are undisputed. there's a reason sony did everything they could to feed the trolls, thereby engendering a pre-release discussion presumably designed specifically to make women feel under siege, then offering the ""solace"" of a movie that was made ""just for you."" 
so, was it successful on those terms? i think a lot of the sequences you would have cut are precisely designed to reinforce the sense that the female characters are being mocked, shamed, or disrespected, including the ""michael hat"" scene. 
the only question i have is whether it was actually funny to the target audience. which is fine by me, but i pity people whose problems lead them to seek to demonize half the population."
"8510","that hearse is pretty. i'd drive that. i'd buy that."
"8511","stantz. it's german. don't look for an explanation."
"8512","one thing to remember about the original, and i'm quoting mostly from lindsay ellis here, is that it was very... reagan. they're portrayed as these plucky entrepreneurs who are private sector and good unlike the bad, bureaucratic government who wants to regulate them which is bad. 

in other words, it's everything i hate about american portrayals of private sector / public sector dynamics. it's deeply unsympathetic to the government and treats the private sector not just as heroes, but as inherently small and important and under the thumb of mean, bad, unnecessary regulation."
"8513","what killed the movie for me is too much improv"
"8514","i woulda included the ""you were right"""
"8515","more jokes =/= funny is why i couldn't enjoy thor ragnarok. well, that and the terrible pacing."
"8516","holy shit some real critique, its not just ""women are in it, i hate this"""
"8517","this analysis has real.. character"
"8518","is it bad that i like the ""mike hat"" joke?"
"8519","it was ass"
"8520","i understand your complaints. i just disagree.

also, there's some cathartic humor to hemsworth's character for women. female characters, especially in older movies, were often stupid and always making things worse. it's hyperbolic compared to some examples.... but sadly not others..."
"8521","it seems far worse than what i thought it would be. i thought it was just overblown ""feminists are ruining everything! womeeeen!!!!11"" a movie about how the production was ruined from a potentially better remake or sequel has better comedic potential, even though it would perhaps be somewhat of a rip-off of _the tv set_ (2006), in this broad aspect of the story."
"8522","what really annoyed the crap out of me was the constant dancing"
"8523","well, to be fair they were broke enough to not be able to buy the firehouse, that's why they got the place they did, and they were so broke that patty had to get them the hearse. but i can see all the problems you saw with the movie, not saying that this one thing you got wrong made the movie good. the movie still is quite flawed in many of the ways you said. i do agree, but i just wanted to say that you were missing out on this one part. but i don't really like the original movies that much either. i feel like, although the original movie was made okay, but it really didn't age well, at least not for me."
"8524","i enjoyed the movie for what it was when i saw it, but i hadn't actually seen the original so didn't have that sort of baseline.

i really want to see the shaun cut though. the other comedy clips you contrasted the film with were way funnier and your quick edits got a lot more of a laugh out of me than the sort of low level amusement i got from the original cut."
"8525","i'm a fan of melissa mccarthy's schtick of steamrolling over the gravity of the situation around her with self-centered, obsessive nonsense. it's basically the entire movie the heat, and it totally works for me. in ghostbusters, it works as long as it's just her and the cop, because it's a force of personality trampling what should be an authority figure in an inappropriate situation. then a third character jumps in and it becomes a generic ""let's all be silly together"". so yeah, that's another edit point.
i also love kate mckinnon's uncanny ability to sell zany behavior. she always looks like she's really into it, ""it"" being something utterly unfathomable to everyone else. it also makes sense than an anarchistic crank would be the kind of research assistant a disgraced ghost hunter could attract, so her eccentricity leads her to this enterprise.
i appreciate leslie jones's part more for your pointing out that she does the best job staying in character. as the one who's a blue-collar worker rather than a ghost scientist, she should be the most down-to-earth, and she is. her decision to join isn't tremendously well motivated, but i don't think we needed an explicit depiction of her obsession getting her fired. she showed up there because of her obsession, and that's enough to fit her in with the misfits.
chris hemsworth was there entirely to serve as a trope inversion. what if the implausibly sexy idiot secretary... was a man!? they knowingly sacrificed character believability to do that, and i support the goal even if a lot of his bits were more frustrating than entertaining.
i am not a fan of kristen wiig's sad wet kitten in the rain routine. her whole character is a trash bag blowing in the wind. everything she is is just a series of the worst thing happening to her. the recurring character wiig plays always tries to ingratiate herself to everyone and ends up offending the most. it's the wrong kind of awkward to be enjoyable, the kind where our protagonist was in control of it enough to easily avoid it but not such that she's actively inflicting it on bystanders or competently riding it out. it's one long ""poor me, i have no agency"" joke, and i cringe through the whole thing.
that, i think, is why i enjoyed your proposed edit tremendously. it cuts out wiig's pointlessly agonizing kick-the-dog montage and instead moves that to implied offscreen action, allowing it to motivate a confrontation where she controls the action and expresses herself. much better!"
"8526","23:12
i would have added ""you were right..."""
"8527","i also think the attitude was 'we'll get a sequel and improve things then'."
"8528","great video. i watched this on dvd recently and while i thought it was 'ok', i pretty much hit the nail on the head on everything [especially the action being a special effects fest]. i actually didn't mind holtzman antics but that's because her character is wacky, but i didn't care for any of the characters, cause as you say, they keep breaking character. but they want it both ways so you also have the holtzman speech about friends or the bit when erin rescues abby-both scenes looks for pathos and fall flat because you don't care. and completely agree with kevin being one boring joke repeated ad nausea."
"8529","i was watching the gb clips thinking 'they don't seem that bad' until the father ted clip made me (actually) laugh for a good thirty seconds. i never watched the gb remake and i'm glad, but also sad. it would have been cool to see some lady ghostbusters in a movie that gave them room to be, you know, engaging and likable and funny."
"8530","i quite liked it. had a good time. i didn't really think of it was a comedy ha-ha movie, but a semi-quirky action thing where i mostly paid attention to the ghosts, tech, colors and that one character i think is kinda hot. it's not funny like ghostbusters or hot fuzz, but still, i chuckled at times. good enough to watch

edit: holtzmann is perfect and i love her"
"8531","now, that's how you edit a movie!!!
great review, man! i loved it!"
"8532","your recut implied firing actually made me laugh"
"8533","in the original peter. ray and egon got thrown out of the university not college because they had their funding cut so the university couldn't afford the research and unit some people pray on others mistakes when they make them as well . frankie croft smales"
"8534","holtzmann is funny because she's flirting with erin, thats my only criticism. love your videos"
"8535","re-cutting the movie probably wouldn't change much, the problem with this movie is that it has no script. most of the movie is improv by actors which puts even more blame on them for shitty jokes. conversation in a restaurant took about 7 hours to film, and what they put in the movie apparently was the best footage they had. watch ralphmoviemaker's review on it."
"8536","i just discovered your videos taking cinemasins down a peg and i'm so happy i did lol you're a dope awesome critic, beyond clever and aware: side note, would it...maybe be at all possible to talk a little faster? lol i've been thinking the same thing about cinemasins for a while too lol they used to be good and actually observant, but they became tryhard douchebags after they started catering to the greatest majority of fans (for views and money) as opposed to...actually thinking about the things they write lol"
"8537","honestly, wow. your re-cuts are pretty good. especially the one where she gets fired, that would've been absolutely the right call"
"8538","that walk it was a play on the walk of shame, something that resonates with a lot of women because they are often shamed in life. i don't think a man can really find this funny, i didn't, my wife did though, and we've been together since we were 19, so not like it hit home.but women are often publicly shamed for no reason and deliberate denial in the face of shaming is funny, especially when the shame is undeniable. but yeah it was  mediocre."
"8539","and men are more likely to cheat on their wives than vice versa. i don't know what bps was snorting when he came up with these facts."
"8540","if he's trying to make this a sex or gender issue... bps is forgetting that most wars and genocides and falls of civilizations have been orchestrated by men.

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"8541","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"8542","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"8543","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"8544","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"8545","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"8590","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

"8627","32:41 and we know that none of those 80 000 who have been rejected have been deported from sweden.  

33:13 we know that the people who will be coming with family reunification will also be male because of the massive gender imbalance of asia (which includes the middle east), it will be, a father, and some brothers and maybe an uncle.  

omg you lie so much here why does anyone follow you???"
"8628","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"8629","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"8641","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"8642","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"8643","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"8644","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"8645","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"8655","yeah, the only french people in vichy who collaborated with the nazis were horny women."
"8656","the idea that sex may cause low productive is interesting. but when it comes from incels who have no sex and contribute nothing to society it's utterly hilarious."

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched.

"8790","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"8791","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."

"8813","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

"8890","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

"8927","32:41 and we know that none of those 80 000 who have been rejected have been deported from sweden.  

33:13 we know that the people who will be coming with family reunification will also be male because of the massive gender imbalance of asia (which includes the middle east), it will be, a father, and some brothers and maybe an uncle.  

omg you lie so much here why does anyone follow you???"
"8928","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"8929","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"8941","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"8942","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"8943","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"8944","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"8945","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"8955","yeah, the only french people in vichy who collaborated with the nazis were horny women."

33:13 we know that the people who will be coming with family reunification will also be male because of the massive gender imbalance of asia (which includes the middle east), it will be, a father, and some brothers and maybe an uncle.  

omg you lie so much here why does anyone follow you???"
"9028","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"9029","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"9085","so basically white supremacist men have an inferiority complex, and think of men of other ethnicities are more attractive to than them, so white women will flock to the brown people. these people need to get this idea that brown skin means lower iq and bigger dick out of their head, and women are dumb because they only care about big dicks. i think these alt right kids watch too much interracial gang bang porn, and that is where they get their idea of white women and brown men. going outside and meeting people who come from different backgrounds would do them some real good.

"9090","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"9091","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."
"9092","what up cucks?     must be sad thinking people give a fuck about what u have to say when 95% of people who click on this video did it accidentally because they are misled by your title but wanted to listen to bps....  good luck with your mass pigeon is bad campaign!!!!!"

"9105","and i thought all the bullshit around me about ""female inferiority"" was due to me living in middle east and islam being the dominant religion in the country... turns out it's the same as america. and christians apparently dont differ even slightly from islamists when it comes to women.

"9108","i like most of your stuff, but i feel like i must disagree with you in regards to one particular thing. your example of japanese soldiers fighting for america seems to be a little misleading. they were americans. i know it may seem tiny and pointless, but it's frustrating because of the history attached. during that time, japanese-americans were put in internment camps because they weren't seen as real americans. they're american in the same way an a person of irish or english descent is american."

"9113","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

omg you lie so much here why does anyone follow you???"
"9228","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"9229","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"9241","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"9242","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"9243","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"9244","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"9245","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"9328","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"9329","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"9390","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"9391","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."
"9392","what up cucks?     must be sad thinking people give a fuck about what u have to say when 95% of people who click on this video did it accidentally because they are misled by your title but wanted to listen to bps....  good luck with your mass pigeon is bad campaign!!!!!"

i died laughing. thank you"

"9405","and i thought all the bullshit around me about ""female inferiority"" was due to me living in middle east and islam being the dominant religion in the country... turns out it's the same as america. and christians apparently dont differ even slightly from islamists when it comes to women.

"9408","i like most of your stuff, but i feel like i must disagree with you in regards to one particular thing. your example of japanese soldiers fighting for america seems to be a little misleading. they were americans. i know it may seem tiny and pointless, but it's frustrating because of the history attached. during that time, japanese-americans were put in internment camps because they weren't seen as real americans. they're american in the same way an a person of irish or english descent is american."

"9412","everyone know that if women climax during rape that means they liked it.."
"9413","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

"9528","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"9529","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"9541","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"9542","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"9543","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"9544","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"9545","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"9569","i'm pretty sure that women for a good 100,00 years or something, evolved to put the group before things outside the group, and that's why gossip is even a thing. if i remember correctly from what i read about protohumans or something.

"9576","but nah sexism has totally ended"
"9577","shaun your wrong look what happened in france when the germans invaded in world war 2. if you were a women sleeping with the enemy you got your head shaved.  if you were a man who              co-operate with the enemy you got shot. french women went over to the enemy in large numbers. the punishment for a woman was a joke. a bad man makes a women's heart beat faster.nice guys finish last."

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"9690","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"9691","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."
"9692","what up cucks?     must be sad thinking people give a fuck about what u have to say when 95% of people who click on this video did it accidentally because they are misled by your title but wanted to listen to bps....  good luck with your mass pigeon is bad campaign!!!!!"

i died laughing. thank you"

"9705","and i thought all the bullshit around me about ""female inferiority"" was due to me living in middle east and islam being the dominant religion in the country... turns out it's the same as america. and christians apparently dont differ even slightly from islamists when it comes to women.

"9708","i like most of your stuff, but i feel like i must disagree with you in regards to one particular thing. your example of japanese soldiers fighting for america seems to be a little misleading. they were americans. i know it may seem tiny and pointless, but it's frustrating because of the history attached. during that time, japanese-americans were put in internment camps because they weren't seen as real americans. they're american in the same way an a person of irish or english descent is american."

"9712","everyone know that if women climax during rape that means they liked it.."
"9713","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

"9828","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"9829","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"9841","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"9842","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"9843","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"9844","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"9845","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"9876","but nah sexism has totally ended"
"9877","shaun your wrong look what happened in france when the germans invaded in world war 2. if you were a women sleeping with the enemy you got your head shaved.  if you were a man who              co-operate with the enemy you got shot. french women went over to the enemy in large numbers. the punishment for a woman was a joke. a bad man makes a women's heart beat faster.nice guys finish last."

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"9990","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"9991","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."

"10013","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

"10129","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"10142","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"10143","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"10144","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"10145","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"10229","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"10290","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"10291","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."

"10313","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

33:13 we know that the people who will be coming with family reunification will also be male because of the massive gender imbalance of asia (which includes the middle east), it will be, a father, and some brothers and maybe an uncle.  

omg you lie so much here why does anyone follow you???"
"10428","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"10429","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

"10442","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"10443","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"10444","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"10445","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

omg you lie so much here why does anyone follow you???"
"10528","this is the 2nd video of shaun i have watch so does he bring up nazis in all of them?  i guess when you have weak arguments or none at all, yelling nazi , is all you have.  everyone hates nazis and rightfully so, but it doesn't make a weak arguments correct."
"10529","when i was doing studies for demographics of male/female in canada about 5 years ago it shows between 18 and 55 over 500 000 more men than women.   they changed the numbers and it doesn't reflect anything that is honest.   i have seen many pictures of refugees walking, on boats, or climbing the gates in europe and the vast majority show men.  so if you start quoting obvious lies. you are finished shaun as anyone to be taken seriously. 

example,  asia murdered 1 billion women over the last 50-60 years (abortion, gender selection, honour killings, what ever)  in doing so they created a gender imbalance in their countries that is devastating.  example  china 170 000 000 single men because no women to marry,  india 120 000 000 single males, easily researched. 

so there are few women to cross and immigrate even if they wanted to.   your videos are so flawed."

but hey. actual evidence doesn't matter when you have feelings on your side."
"10541","lord, this comment section is full of brainwashed cucks. also this guy tried to nit pick everything that was said. i guess someone doesnt know what patterns are. but the really funny part is how he failed to rebute the fact that women vote left, he didnt even tried it, wonder why. women are all in bigger government, diversity and no borders and that will ultimately end our society. theres no need to get around in words. theres no rebuttal to this"
"10542","chastity has always been a male method of controlling women, along with ""purity"", because it's all about the bloodlines to these men. it's all about the collectivist ""master race"", it's all about punishing individuality and dissent and free thinking on the part of women and ""beta males"" who dare to stand up to the bullshit chauvinism propagated by the spreaders of the alpha male disease. apparently these men haven't heard the news that we're no longer amongst the other animals. but fascists have always admired the predatory animals, haven't they? they have always admired ""life as it should be"". they decry civilization. they scream, along with martin luther, that ""reason is the devil's whore"". they blame the jews, whom martin luther also hated. they blame any non-homogeneity they can find for the state of the world. they consider femininity a ""weakness"" and their masculinity as ""strength"". history is a catalog of male crimes perpetrated against the personhood of women as human beings. male supremacy is nihilism, for the male would always hold absolute power, and there would be no equity for women or men who do not conform to bullshit gender expectations."
"10543","these male supremacists are hypocrites who don't care about the facts, which they'll crop and twist to suit their anti-female agenda. to attack a woman's agency is to attack women for existing. fuck the primal male. his time is over. the primal male belongs with the other dead fossils of earth's history."
"10544","if these men hate women so much, why don't they be gay for each other?"
"10545","men's rights advocates (mras) and their mgtow comrades and related anti-feminist groups destroy civilization, because women are a civilizing influence. look at gilgamesh's friend enkidu, who was civilized by a priestess of inanna, beauty taming the beast, or beauty bringing out the beast's latent potential for humanity. women are civilization, and male attempts to control their bodies and their lives effectuate the destruction of civilization in the name of civilization. these sad men are angry that women exist, like hesiod's yearning for a female-less golden age, a yearning shared by the authors of the male supremacist garden of eden story."

"10569","i'm pretty sure that women for a good 100,00 years or something, evolved to put the group before things outside the group, and that's why gossip is even a thing. if i remember correctly from what i read about protohumans or something.

so i am utterly confused why he thinks women want to sell the group out."

"10576","but nah sexism has totally ended"
"10577","shaun your wrong look what happened in france when the germans invaded in world war 2. if you were a women sleeping with the enemy you got your head shaved.  if you were a man who              co-operate with the enemy you got shot. french women went over to the enemy in large numbers. the punishment for a woman was a joke. a bad man makes a women's heart beat faster.nice guys finish last."

"10585","so basically white supremacist men have an inferiority complex, and think of men of other ethnicities are more attractive to than them, so white women will flock to the brown people. these people need to get this idea that brown skin means lower iq and bigger dick out of their head, and women are dumb because they only care about big dicks. i think these alt right kids watch too much interracial gang bang porn, and that is where they get their idea of white women and brown men. going outside and meeting people who come from different backgrounds would do them some real good.

"10589","lmao he thinks women shouldn't be able to vote?"
"10590","i would almost certainly categorize this content producer and distributor as dangerous to the intellectual health of the conservative community on youtube. he posits wild and exaggerated claims that fulfill a far-fetched and hateful narrative with no substantial backing. while men and women are inherently different physically and mentally, their places in society do not have to be forced upon them in a controlling, unfair and oppressive manner. if, indeed, women and men do possess natural tendencies to fulfill specific roles that benefit from their natural selves, then they will gravitate to said roles regardless of the state or culture's attempt to force or aggressively persuade them to do so. men and women both suffer from the same human condition -- they both are dangerously opportunistic, unfaithful, often lazy, etc.. it is manipulative to highlight only women in the negative light they deserve while wrongly painting men as the heroes that save civilization; it is only through the efforts of both men and women that we can secure and protect freedom and continue our pursuit towards health, fulfillment and much else in the western world and beyond. the two sexes work side by side, fulfilling roles that suit them -- often in correspondence with the qualities afforded to them by their sex -- to accomplish the shared victories held in such esteem by our societies, nations, and states in this ever-changing yet ever-similar world dictated by such consistent yet commonly misunderstood biological principles. cheerio."
"10591","it is us men who pretty much destroy civilizations. we're the ones who used to go and invade people's lands, destroy culture and take women away from those who are deemed as the weak. i don't see how there can be any logic to suggest women destroy civilizations. nothing can be more destructive than men who conquers through force and violence, in the name of glory and superiority."
"10592","what up cucks?     must be sad thinking people give a fuck about what u have to say when 95% of people who click on this video did it accidentally because they are misled by your title but wanted to listen to bps....  good luck with your mass pigeon is bad campaign!!!!!"

i died laughing. thank you"
"10602","this video is incredible, came over from your response to ""what every girl needs to hear"" and you really just go above and beyond with your research and your arguments and everything surrounding them. a lot of people just work off of faith not only that they are right, but that the audience is on their side and thus don't feel the need to research and cite sources as well as you do. video was also incredibly entertaining - i can't think of any other creator who's content was so consistently fantastic even two years ago, really great work!"
"10603","but why would a misogynist even want to be with a woman? i will never understand why misogynists spout and hate on women so much yet will demand that they have women? explain this confusion to me pleeaaaase!!!!"
"10604","you could have just said yes and ended the video. talk about milking ad revenue"
"10605","and i thought all the bullshit around me about ""female inferiority"" was due to me living in middle east and islam being the dominant religion in the country... turns out it's the same as america. and christians apparently dont differ even slightly from islamists when it comes to women. 
sorry for you fellas but all your american dreams and your famous western civilization and taxes you pay and everything simply dont give you a better life standart than you would have in turkey. 
i wonder if this goes the same for all of the west or is it just usa?"

"10608","i like most of your stuff, but i feel like i must disagree with you in regards to one particular thing. your example of japanese soldiers fighting for america seems to be a little misleading. they were americans. i know it may seem tiny and pointless, but it's frustrating because of the history attached. during that time, japanese-americans were put in internment camps because they weren't seen as real americans. they're american in the same way an a person of irish or english descent is american."

"10612","everyone know that if women climax during rape that means they liked it.."
"10613","unwin's work seems pretty interesting but ultimately as it seems huxley pointed out, it seems rather over-simplified. it reminds me of something freudian, as if literally everything done by an individual or collectively as a society is only a by product of sex. yes, sex is obviously an important driver but the thought that people would literally stop wanting to do productive work because they can get laid seems to directly contradict what i see in reality. sex can often be an anxiety/depression reducing act that makes one want to go out into the world and act/help. 

a correlation between chastity and successful societies might have actually been causitive in the past, when (without birth control) the consequences for being unfaithful were extremely high. but now, that's ofc not the case and beyond an unrealistic expectation that people who get laid a lot will lose interest in greater society, which i doubt is true, it seems to me that our more sexually permissive norms don't have any major negative consequences."

he's a walking mra stereotype, trilby and all. the only thing that sets him apart is his academic background. he's already rallying the hoards while trans faculty members are getting violent threats. it's pretty awful. he's poised to become something of an mra darling.

when this person i know has the video ready, i am going to send you a link to his video for you to watch about stefan, to make you understand what a manipulative, psychopath, liar and woman hater he is.
he even pretends to be women and has been caught. evidence is provided.
your channel will have great success. talent and intelligence like yours is getting noticed.

"10672","yeah, it's a real surreal experience looking at how many alt-right youtube channels there are. this is probably the weirdest one out there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f5ojdwmpv8 anyway, i love your content, can't wait to see more of it in the future!"

"10677","i think personally you might wanna wait a little bit before asking for money, probs until you've got a line of work that you can feel proud of and then find yourself feeling better about asking for donations. i've got 5k currently and not even i feel happy yet with my line of work :)"

"10679","red pandas are swell creatures"
"10680","i'm somewhat curious what your thoughts would be on game theory's video about the pokemon jynx. i say somewhat, because it's hard to tell how serious the videos on that channel are meant to be, but then many of the channels followers seem credulous to them. however, it could just be on the fans for taking it so seriously rather than on gt itself. i also say somewhat because even though the channel seems part in jest, the particular video makes many fallacies like false-dichotomies and hasty generalizations  but seems to present them as valid. i continue to emphasize ""somewhat"" because a response video to a big channel like that could result in many trolls attacking your channel, which i'm tired of seeing happen to channels like this or kristi winters or contrapoints or laci green."

i love both the movie stuff and the alt-right critique stuff, but i wanted to ask if you were planning on doing more video game content? your minecraft and contradiction let's plays with jen were highly entertaining and i would definitely be into more of it, whether it be just you or both you and jen."
"10683","hi! i've decided to spam your channel until you bring back the notsoamazing atheist video (with or without the part that you disliked about it)."
"10684","does sargon not know that satire has a very specific target to be satirizing and overall has a point? it's not satire if it doesn't have a demographic to be making fun of. jokes have meaning like in jim jefferies'' gun control skit he demonstrates how ineffective it would be to own a gun for self defense and also have it safely secure in your home so it doesn't hurt anyone accidentally. imo no satire is ever ""just satire"", if it's ""just satire"" then it's not satire or at least it's really bad satire."
"10685","dogs barking? obviously you're just ripping off hbomb.

i really like this channel and i get excited when i see a new video in my feed. you've articulated a lot of points that i wish i could put together myself, so thanks! oh and if you want any primary research for any encounters you may have with self-professed ""race realists,"" i can definitely hook you up."
"10688","patreon tips!
-nope it doesn't cost money
-you can charge per video or per month (most people seem to prefer per month, as they'll know how much money they wanna budget for you)
-it's definitely more helpful the more fans you have! you can probably get a few bucks with the following you have now, but the more subs you have, the better off the patreon will be. people will pretty much only find your patreon page through your videos or social media.
-having reward tiers to incentivize higher donations is a big deal for donors and very worth doing!
-having tiers which award direct participation with your channel (ie: ""vote for which video topic you want me to cover next"") is very helpful as well.
-if i were you, i might consider ads for now. i feel like lots of people accept ads as a fact of life, as their payment in exchange for getting free entertainment. the rest of them have adblock anyway. i've gotten quite a few folks donating to my patreon that admitted they donate because they have adblock on and they wanna make up for it.

hit me up on twitter if you have any more questions :)"

sargon however has no excuse, clearly detailing an argument with evident research but its just a ""joke"""

it's easy to see how the concept began as the punchline for a joke.  and tbh it's not a bad joke if the goal is making fun of the left, but mundane matt and company have such a complex about being taken seriously that this simple exaggeration joke ends up becoming their actual line of contention.  it's why every one of them pulls out the ""it's satire"" excuse. they confuse satire with trying to be funny and serious at the same time."

"10738","tim o'niel has what he calls the east/west test.  you see lots of things blamed for the weste's fall in the 400s, both be conservative and liberal revisionists, were equally a factor in the east which lasted another thousand years.  whether you're blaming christianity, or barbarian incursions, or decadence, or what ever.

the different between the west and the east at that time was most of the empire's wealth came from the east, so when the two sides stopped cooperating the west had no money."

"10744","if woman would choose nice guys over assholes, we wouldnt have the glorious stefan.
hahahahahahaha."
"10745","here's a suggestion: maybe instead of blaming women for ""choosing assholes"", you should look into your heart and work on being a better person. or maybe you should make sure you don't legitimatize assholes as partners with the way you act around your partner and child.

"10750","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

edit: i should say that while molyneux and the like claim to want the facts, obviously they don't actually abide by that. should make that clear."

"10755","i think stefan and manyy right wingers like him might just be incels"
"10756","no. a true hero does not just honor his culture and enjoy the fruits of all they've done, good or bad. a true hero acknowledges the evils of their people and is willing to sacrifice their freedom and that which they have gained from their institution for what is right and for those who don't have those same freedoms. what stefan is describing as a hero is what i'd describe as a leech. a coward. yet also the champion of those ideals to which they benefit. and in a way a champion can interchangeably be used to define a hero. but as we mostly like to view heroes as defenders of that which is morally right, i would see more to defining them as such, and correct stefan's ""heroes"" as being champions at best. and champions are based more on the philosophy of might males right. because their society won, they are right. but we all know they are not. righteousness is not made from winning a fight. it is taking the uncomfortable position for the sake of those with less."

"10759","there are so many lies in this response i just had to stop listening to it. dude contradicts himself every 8 seconds. i don't care about moleneux, but he lies less than this guy."
"10760","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"

ok, i did, where's my prize :d
great video, by the way. i've seen numerous theories about what caused fall or the roman empire from a modern political standpoint, and always thought they were all bullshit, including those that suited me ideologically. (e.g. one theory blamed it on lack of democracy, the other blamed it on christianity from an atheistic standpoint, ...). every moment in history should be looked only through the prism of its own time and not equated with what we have today.."

"10781","24:53 he did not say ""women are the root of all evil"". he said they perpetuate the cycle of domestic abuse by marrying abusive men who in turn create an abusive environment for their children who grow up and become abusive assholes themselves. and by women, he's of course not referring to all women who have ever existed. he is specifically referring to women who engage in sexual relations and create families with shitty men.

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"10850","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

"10860","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"10960","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

arab here: the abbasid loss of control, and fragmentation of the caliphate, had nil to do with either invasions or women. i don't need to watch the rest to mnow he's full of shit.

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"10995","the fact that molyneux decides to use rome's 6th century population (""in the 500s"" he says, so yeah 6th century) to prove his inane point about women not having enough babies gets extra hysterical when you consider that, in addition to all the stuff shaun brings up, there was kinda a fairly major war going on in italy during the 500s. the decades-long ""gothic war"" was a war of reconquest pursued by the eastern roman empire under emperor justinian against the ostrogothic kingdom of italy to return the lost territories to roman rule. rome changed hands multiple times during that conflict, and that sorta stuff tends to be bad for population growth. all of italy, in fact, was pretty badly affected by that war."

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"11093","rome's fall was partly due to immigration but that was largely due to the specific fact that they pretty much relied on german immigrants as the basis of their national defense. and if you are looking for sone kind of comparison they still treated these migrants terribly calked them uncivilized barbarians and still pretty much gave them no respect whatsoever for the services they depended apon them for. there were also elements such as rome generally not paying well their highly skilled highly army in general as well as that the empire had just gotten too huge to control and was also just simply wearing out."

"11150","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

the different between the west and the east at that time was most of the empire's wealth came from the east, so when the two sides stopped cooperating the west had no money."

"11250","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

"11260","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"

ok, i did, where's my prize :d

"11350","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

"11360","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"11460","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

arab here: the abbasid loss of control, and fragmentation of the caliphate, had nil to do with either invasions or women. i don't need to watch the rest to mnow he's full of shit.

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"11593","rome's fall was partly due to immigration but that was largely due to the specific fact that they pretty much relied on german immigrants as the basis of their national defense. and if you are looking for sone kind of comparison they still treated these migrants terribly calked them uncivilized barbarians and still pretty much gave them no respect whatsoever for the services they depended apon them for. there were also elements such as rome generally not paying well their highly skilled highly army in general as well as that the empire had just gotten too huge to control and was also just simply wearing out."

"11650","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

the different between the west and the east at that time was most of the empire's wealth came from the east, so when the two sides stopped cooperating the west had no money."

"11750","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

edit: i should say that while molyneux and the like claim to want the facts, obviously they don't actually abide by that. should make that clear."

"11759","there are so many lies in this response i just had to stop listening to it. dude contradicts himself every 8 seconds. i don't care about moleneux, but he lies less than this guy."
"11760","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"
"11761","""if you make it through this video you get a prize.""
ok, i did, where's my prize :d
great video, by the way. i've seen numerous theories about what caused fall or the roman empire from a modern political standpoint, and always thought they were all bullshit, including those that suited me ideologically. (e.g. one theory blamed it on lack of democracy, the other blamed it on christianity from an atheistic standpoint, ...). every moment in history should be looked only through the prism of its own time and not equated with what we have today.."

"11850","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

"11860","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"11928","not sure what tribes specifically he is talking about but in general ""warfare in tribal communities is frequently marked by blood-feuds and revenge hostility but does not usually entail large scale campaigns of genocidal warfare against enemy groups. (...)as opposed to non-western tribal societies, european state-level societies tend to be marked by large-scale genocidal warfare against enemy nations."" from ""genocidal warfare in tribal societies as a result of european-induced culture conflict""."

"11936","is stefan a nice guy?"
"11937","i hate to nit pick you, but empire is a term that is irrelevant to the form of government.  polybius wrote a book called ""the rise of the roman empire"" he died before julius caesar was born.  rome was an empire long before the pincepate."
"11938","tim o'niel has what he calls the east/west test.  you see lots of things blamed for the weste's fall in the 400s, both be conservative and liberal revisionists, were equally a factor in the east which lasted another thousand years.  whether you're blaming christianity, or barbarian incursions, or decadence, or what ever.

the different between the west and the east at that time was most of the empire's wealth came from the east, so when the two sides stopped cooperating the west had no money."
"11939","the way stefan talks about women makes it sound like he is trying to blame his own reproductive short-comings on someone else."
"11940","who would have guessed that this asshole is actually a niceguy in disguise?"
"11941","he's a cult leader using the same tactics as many who came before him."
"11942","his logic is amazing. the whole ""women are responsible for the assholes because they date them, marry them and birth them!"" does he believe in like the continuous grain of evil or something. like if we would just kill all the assholes and therefore women couldn't date them anymore and procreate with them, we'd achieve paradise on earth?"
"11943","wow people come out of vaginas? i never would've known, women birth children? what a ridiculous statement, everyone knows humans come from eggs!"
"11944","if woman would choose nice guys over assholes, we wouldnt have the glorious stefan.
hahahahahahaha."
"11945","here's a suggestion: maybe instead of blaming women for ""choosing assholes"", you should look into your heart and work on being a better person. or maybe you should make sure you don't legitimatize assholes as partners with the way you act around your partner and child.

or not. i mean, i'm not gonna make you. that would just be rude of me, wouldn't it?"

"11949","is his core audience made up of white incels or something? he seems to constantly try to ingrain in them that they're offspring of some amazing tribe or something, in the conclusion here and in vids like the anglo saxon rises or whatever make me think that must be the target audience, the only people who would actually be in a plausible situation to drink this kool aid. sad"
"11950","the part of all this that makes me depressed is that ppl like molyneux often claim to really want the facts, to tell it like it is etc. the depressing part is they sort of have a point there because there are some subjects that many liberals generally refuse to discuss factually (say differences between men and women, or that as far as religions go, islam is likely to be more dangerous than mormonism). this is why it's so important for liberals/progressives/whatever to be as committed to the truth as possible with *everything*, because when we aren't it opens the door to right wing hacks/loons like this guy to come in. i think a large part of the trump phenomenon for example has been fueled by this uber pc culture, we really have to be careful with this. 

btw not saying your doing this or anything, for the most part from what i've seen so far you seem very committed to evidence with all these topics, this just brought the point to mind.

edit: i should say that while molyneux and the like claim to want the facts, obviously they don't actually abide by that. should make that clear."

"11955","i think stefan and manyy right wingers like him might just be incels"
"11956","no. a true hero does not just honor his culture and enjoy the fruits of all they've done, good or bad. a true hero acknowledges the evils of their people and is willing to sacrifice their freedom and that which they have gained from their institution for what is right and for those who don't have those same freedoms. what stefan is describing as a hero is what i'd describe as a leech. a coward. yet also the champion of those ideals to which they benefit. and in a way a champion can interchangeably be used to define a hero. but as we mostly like to view heroes as defenders of that which is morally right, i would see more to defining them as such, and correct stefan's ""heroes"" as being champions at best. and champions are based more on the philosophy of might males right. because their society won, they are right. but we all know they are not. righteousness is not made from winning a fight. it is taking the uncomfortable position for the sake of those with less."

"11959","there are so many lies in this response i just had to stop listening to it. dude contradicts himself every 8 seconds. i don't care about moleneux, but he lies less than this guy."
"11960","starts out great. i'm a bit rusty in roman history, but it's at least highly probable that he has gotten cause and effect wrong. imo the slaves being brought in was a fact accompanying the growing expansion of roman influence in all of italy towards the end of the republic and the beginning expansion outside of it (like with the punic wars ending up in 180-ish bce that gave rome control over algeria, tunesia, parts of morocco, southern france and spain/portugal... rome technically was an empire in the modern sense of dominating other countries / regions long before it had an emperor... in the time of caesar and augustus that was expanded eastward with greece, egypt and gaul being conquered by what was still a republic). that left the poorer landowners and property less fieldworkers with economical competition they could not ""beat"" so they fled the rural regions and went to the city... comparable to the ""landflucht"" of medieval europe... which led to overcrowded metropolitan rome needing a tool to appease the always incontent masses, which then led to the ""dole"" of free grain. which btw started as ""political gift"" during election campaign season... making it eerily similar to unmotivated ""tax cuts"" molyneux is all for, not of welfare, which is much more longterm and harder fought about.

i've long since given up on following molyneux as his libertarian bs is simply hairraisingly annoying. it seems he has only gotten worse in the last 5 or 6 years with ""libertarian"" now meaning ""having taken leave of his sanity""... i mean... frozen?"
"11961","""if you make it through this video you get a prize.""
ok, i did, where's my prize :d
great video, by the way. i've seen numerous theories about what caused fall or the roman empire from a modern political standpoint, and always thought they were all bullshit, including those that suited me ideologically. (e.g. one theory blamed it on lack of democracy, the other blamed it on christianity from an atheistic standpoint, ...). every moment in history should be looked only through the prism of its own time and not equated with what we have today.."

"11981","24:53 he did not say ""women are the root of all evil"". he said they perpetuate the cycle of domestic abuse by marrying abusive men who in turn create an abusive environment for their children who grow up and become abusive assholes themselves. and by women, he's of course not referring to all women who have ever existed. he is specifically referring to women who engage in sexual relations and create families with shitty men.

i have ingrained bias for stefan because i've watched so many of his videos and i enjoy his content, but in all that time watching, i never witnessed him reach any conclusions that we should revoke women's rights and reinstate slavery. stefan was abused by his single mother as a child, so i believe a lot of his passion and fury stems from a deep place of hurt and he's an extreme advocate for children's protections and rights. i admire him for those things and i want to say it's not that he wants women to be forced into traditional gender roles. he just believes children need to have someone, be it the mother or the father, to be there most, if not all, of the time to raise them up gently and nurture them into functional adults. he's a stay at home dad to further back up his case because he doesn't want his daughter to be neglected in the daycare system. that's my interpretation of what he believes at least. his politics come from a place of genuine good and i appreciate him for it. but i really love watching your videos because they give me insight into the other side of the argument i haven't been exposed to nearly enough. thank you for pointing out the errors in his lecture."

"11985","i love you mentioning game of thrones. i am a hundred percent sure, that molyneux never read the books. but i don't know if he knows the series. but as far as his arguments go, i would bet he would hate the mainstreaming and streamlining of the conflicts in game of thrones in comparison to the books.

in the books almost every conflict is extremely complex. there are dominant factors but also minor ones at first, which become mayor ones later. and molyneux does the same shit. he takes a highly complex topic, sees two kind of similair things and says they are the same.

it is dishonest and not representative of the actual history. it's like the series of game of thrones saying white walkers are bad. they are behind a wall, kill some of the humans (although they invade their land) and look different. so they must be bad. while in the books it is more ominous. they attack but also get attacked. anything beside that is not known. the show made it into their main story arc. i hope that grrm will have a different conclusion. maybe one where ""the others"" were chaes off their land, after that the wall was built and for the last centuries they tried to take it back or even make piece, but by looking different they get demonized."

arab here: the abbasid loss of control, and fragmentation of the caliphate, had nil to do with either invasions or women. i don't need to watch the rest to mnow he's full of shit.

instead, the real reason shit got ugly in the 10th century was becasue al-mutawakkil was assassinated by his own son. his brother then killed him, then the nephew...

sufficed to say, 10 years of constant assassinations, coups, etc in samarra make it hard to keep an empire together-one that already had massive centrifugal forces tearing at it ( what we'd call secession movements today were common: berbers wanted out becasue the arabs didn't give enough, various arabs wanted out due to religious and political differences with each other, the turks wanted political power, and not just military power-all in an empire the size of canada...

by 920, the qaramitah had take over arabia and sacked makkah, the banu taghli  had seceeded with northern syria (the hamadanids), and turks had de facto become independent in egypt (tulunids), whuch so destabilized the maghreb the fatimids took over tunisia (they then later took egypt)"

"11995","the fact that molyneux decides to use rome's 6th century population (""in the 500s"" he says, so yeah 6th century) to prove his inane point about women not having enough babies gets extra hysterical when you consider that, in addition to all the stuff shaun brings up, there was kinda a fairly major war going on in italy during the 500s. the decades-long ""gothic war"" was a war of reconquest pursued by the eastern roman empire under emperor justinian against the ostrogothic kingdom of italy to return the lost territories to roman rule. rome changed hands multiple times during that conflict, and that sorta stuff tends to be bad for population growth. all of italy, in fact, was pretty badly affected by that war."
